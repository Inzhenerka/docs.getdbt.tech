You can optionally use the `volatility` config to describe how predictable the user-defined function (UDF) output is by using `deterministic`, `stable`, or `non-deterministic`. Warehouses use this information to decide if results can be cached, reordered, or inlined. Setting the appropriate volatility helps prevent incorrect results when a function isn’t safe to cache or reorder. For example, a function that returns today’s date (`current_date()`) should be set as `non-deterministic`; if it's configured as `volatility: deterministic`, a warehouse might incorrectly cache yesterday’s value and reuse it today.
