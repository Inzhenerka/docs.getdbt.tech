The [dbt extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbtLabsInc.dbt&ssr=false#overview) for VS Code and Cursor, powered by the <Constant name="fusion_engine" />, streamlines dbt development workflows. 

## Prerequisites

To use the extension, you must meet the following prerequisites:

| Prerequisite | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **<Constant name="fusion_engine" />**  | The [dbt VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbtLabsInc.dbt&ssr=false#overview) requires the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> binary (a small executable program). Installing the extension prompts for installation of the <Constant name="fusion_engine" />. You can also [manually install](/docs/fusion/install-fusion) it at any time.|
|  | _Registration_ &mdash; After installation, use the extension for 14 days, then register your email or log in with your existing <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> account to continue using it.<br /><br /> ⁃ _Don't have a dbt account?_ Follow the VS Code “get started” flow to register and verify your email.<br /><br /> ⁃ _Returning user?_ If you have an existing <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> (whether expired or active), no need to register! Just log in with the same email to prevent duplicate accounts. If you cannot log into the account associated with your email or if it's locked, reach out to dbt Support to have it unlocked or reset before logging in. |
| **Project files** | Your dbt project needs a `profiles.yml` configuration file.<br /><br />⁃ dbt platform users need to have a `dbt_cloud.yml` file as well as a `profiles.yml` file configured in their dbt project.<br /><br />⁃ Note that having a <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> user account isn't the same as having a <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> — you  don't need a <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> project to use the extension. |
| **Editor** | [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) code editor. |
| **Operating systems** | macOS, Windows, or Linux-based computer. |

    - **Register:** Launches the registration workflow so you can continue to use the extension beyond the trial period.


## Upgrade to Fusion

:::note

If you are already running the <Constant name="fusion_engine" />, you must be on version `2.0.0-beta.66` or higher to use the upgrade tool.

:::

The dbt extension provides a built-in upgrade tool to walk you through the process of configuring <Constant name="fusion" />  and updating your dbt project to support all of its features and fix any deprecated code. To start the process:

1. From the VS Code sidebar menu, click the **dbt logo**.
2. In the resulting pane, open the **Get started** section and click the **Get started** button. 

    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/extension/fusion-onboarding-experience.png" title="The dbt extension help pane and upgrade assistant." width="60%" /> 

You can also manually start this process by opening a CLI window and running: 

```
dbt init --fusion-upgrade
```

This will start the upgrade tool and guide you through the Fusion upgrade with a series of prompts:
- **Do you have an existing dbt platform account?**: If you answer `Y`, you will be given instructions for downloading your dbt platform profile to register the extension. An `N` answer will skip to the next step.
- **Ready to run a dbtf init?** (If there is no `profiles.yml` file present): You will go through the dbt configuration processes, including connecting to your data warehouse. 
- **Ready to run a dbtf debug?** (If there is an existing `profiles.yml` file): Validates that your project is configured correctly and can connect to your data warehouse.
- **Ready to run a dbtf parse?**: Your dbt project will be parsed to check for compatibility with <Constant name="fusion" />.
    - If any issues are encountered during the parsing, you'll be given the option to run the [dbt-autofix](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-autofix?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) tool to resolve the errors. If you opt to not run the tool during the upgrade processes, you can always run it later or manually fix any errors. However, the upgrade tool cannot continue until the errors are resolved.
        :::tip AI Agents
        There are cases where dbt-autofix may not resolve all errors and requires manual intervention. For those cases, the dbt-autofix tool provides an [AI Agents.md](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-autofix/blob/main/AGENTS.md) file to enable AI agents to help with migration work after dbt-autofix has completed its part.
        :::
- **Ready to run a ‘dbtf compile -static-analysis off’?** (Only runs once the parse passes): Compiles your project without any static analysis, mimicking dbt Core. This compile only renders Jinja into SQL, so <Constant name="fusion" />'s advanced SQL comprehension is temporarily disabled. 
- **Ready to run a ‘dbtf compile’?**: Compiles your project with full <Constant name="fusion" /> static analysis. It checks that your SQL code is valid in the context of your warehouse's tables and columns. 

    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/extension/fusion-onboarding-complete.png" title="The message received when you have completed upgrading your project to the dbt Fusion engine." width="60%" /> 

Once the upgrade is completed, you're ready to dive into all the features that the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> has to offer!

## Register the extension

Users must complete registration within 14 days of installing the dbt extension. There are two ways to register:

- Users without an existing dbt account can register quickly and easily through an online registration form. For the initial installation, you only need to provide your name and email address to complete the registration. Subsequent installations will require you to complete the entire [dbt account registration process](#accessing-your-dbt-account) to use the extension. 
- Users with an existing dbt account can connect their account using a `dbt_cloud.yml` credentials file.

The VS Code extension is free for organizations for up to 15 users.

### New user registration

If you do not already have a dbt account, you'll need to get registered. This only takes a minute!
1. Click the registration prompt in your editor.
     <Lightbox src="/img/docs/extension/registration-prompt.png" width="60%" title="The extension registration prompt in VS Code."/>
2. Accept any prompts to open the link in your browser.
3. Fill out the registration form, then click **Continue**.
    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/extension/registration-screen.png" width="60%" title="The extension registration page in the browser."/>
4. You will receive an email with a verification link. Once you click it, your registration is complete!

### Accessing your dbt account

Registering to use the dbt extension makes it easy to create a full dbt account. You can follow these
steps to finish setting up your account (_Note: This is not required to use the dbt extension_).

1. Navigate to [us1.dbt.com](https://us1.dbt.com) and click **Forgot password?**.
2. Enter the email address you used for your dbt extension registration and click **Continue**.
3. Check your email for a verification link and follow the password reset instructions to set a password for your account.

Now that you have activated your dbt developer account, you can access features of the <Constant name="dbt_platform" />. You can also re-download your registration key using the steps outlined in [Register with an existing dbt account](#register-with-an-existing-dbt-account) if you need to set up the dbt extension on a new machine.

### Register with an existing dbt account 

<!-- This anchor is linked from the VS Code registration page. Please do not change it -->

If you already have a dbt account, you do not need to re-register to use the dbt extension. The dbt extension can authenticate with the dbt platform using a `dbt_cloud.yml` file. If this file is present in your `~/.dbt/` folder, then the registration flow will automatically attempt to use this
file during registration. If you do not have a `~/.dbt/dbt_cloud.yml` file downloaded, refer to the following instructions:

<Expandable alt_header="For dbt accounts with Fusion enabled">

1. Log in to your dbt account.
2. Click your account name at the bottom of the left-side menu and click **Account settings**.
3. Under the **Your profile** section, click **VS Code Extension**. 
4. In the **Set up your credentials** section, click **Download credentials**. This downloads the `dbt_cloud.yml` file. 
    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/extension/download-registration-2.png" width="60%" title="Download the dbt_cloud.yml file to complete registration."/>
5. Move the downloaded `dbt_cloud.yml` file to your `~/.dbt/` directory.
6. To update your registration in VS Code, open the command palette (`ctrl+shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `cmd+shift+p` (macOS)), then select `dbt: Register dbt extension` to complete the registration.

</Expandable>

<Expandable alt_header="For dbt accounts without Fusion enabled">

1. Log in to your dbt account.
2. Click your account name at the bottom of the left-side menu and click **Account settings**.
3. Under the **Your profile** section, click **CLI**. 
4. In the **Configure Cloud authentication** section, click **Download CLI configuration file**. This downloads the `dbt_cloud.yml` file. 
    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/extension/download-registration.png" width="60%" title="Download the dbt_cloud.yml file to complete registration."/>
5. Move the downloaded `dbt_cloud.yml` file to your `~/.dbt/` directory.
6. To update your registration in VS Code, open the command palette (`ctrl+shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `cmd+shift+p` (macOS)), then select `dbt: Register dbt extension` to complete the registration.

## Troubleshooting
<!-- This anchor is linked from the  VS Code extension. Please do not change it -->

#### dbt platform configurations

If you're a cloud-based dbt platform user who has the `dbt-cloud:` config in the `dbt_project.yml` file and are also using [dbt Mesh](/docs/mesh/about-mesh), you must have the project ID configured:

```yaml
dbt-cloud:
  project-id: 12345 # Required
```

If you don’t configure this correctly, cross-platform references will not resolve properly, and you will encounter errors executing dbt commands.

#### General troubleshooting tips

If the dbt extension has activated successfully, you will see the `dbt Extension` label in the status bar at the bottom left of your editor. You can view diagnostic information about the dbt extension by clicking the **dbt Extension** button.

If the dbt extension label is not present, then it is likely that the dbt extension was not installed successfully. If this happens, try uninstalling the extension, restarting your editor, and then reinstalling the extension.

Note: It is possible to "hide" status bar items in VS Code. Double-check if the **dbt Extension** status bar label is hidden by right-clicking on the status bar in your editor. If you see **dbt Extension** in the right-click menu, then the extension has installed successfully.

#### Missing dbt LSP features

If you are not seeing dbt LSP features in your editor, first consult the general troubleshooting steps above. If you have confirmed that the dbt extension is installed correctly, but you still do not see dbt Language Server features (for example, autocomplete, go-to-definition, hover text):
 - Check the version of your dbt extension on the extensions page in your editor. Ensure that you are using the latest available version of the dbt extension.
 - Try reinstalling the dbt Language Server by pressing `cmd+shift+P` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and selecting the `dbt: Reinstall dbt LSP` command.

#### Unsupported dbt version

If you see an error message indicating that your version of dbt is unsupported, then there is likely a problem with your environment.
- Check the **dbt Path** setting in your VS Code settings. If this path is set, ensure that it is pointing to a valid <Constant name="fusion_engine" />  executable.
- If necessary, you can also install the <Constant name="fusion_engine" />  directly using these instructions: [Install the Fusion CLI](/docs/fusion/install-fusion).
