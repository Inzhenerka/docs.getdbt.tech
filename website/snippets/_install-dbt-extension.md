2. Open a dbt project in your VS Code environment if you haven't already. Make sure it is added to your current workspace. If you see a **dbt Extension** label in your editor's status bar, then the extension has installed successfully. You can hover over this **dbt Extension** label to see diagnostic information about the extension.
