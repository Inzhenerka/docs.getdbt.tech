This feature is currently only available for Okta and Entra ID identity providers.

:::

<Constant name="cloud" /> Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans support OAuth authentication with external providers. When **External OAuth** is enabled, users can authorize their Development credentials using single sign-on (SSO) via the identity provider (IdP). External OAuth authorizes users to access multiple applications, including <Constant name="cloud" />, without sharing their static credentials with the service. This makes the process of authenticating for development environments easier for the user and provides an additional layer of security to your <Constant name="cloud" /> account.
