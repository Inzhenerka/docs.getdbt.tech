When you develop in <Constant name="cloud" />, you can leverage [Git](/docs/cloud/git/git-version-control) to version control your code.  

To connect to a repository, you can either set up a <Constant name="cloud" />-hosted [managed repository](/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository) or directly connect to a [supported git provider](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github). Managed repositories are a great way to trial dbt without needing to create a new repository.  In the long run, it's better to connect to a supported git provider to use features like automation and [continuous integration](/docs/deploy/continuous-integration).
