:::caution Available for <Constant name="cloud" /> Enterprise and Enterprise+

Connecting an Azure DevOps cloud account is available for organizations using the <Constant name="cloud" /> Enterprise or Enterprise+ plans. 

<Constant name="cloud" />'s native Azure DevOps integration does not support Azure DevOps Server (on-premise). Instead, you can [import a project by git URL](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url) to connect to an Azure DevOps Server.
