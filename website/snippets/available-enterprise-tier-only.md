:::caution Available for dbt Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise plus

Connecting an Azure DevOps cloud account is available for organizations using the dbt Cloud Enterprise or Enterprise plus plans. 

dbt Cloud's native Azure DevOps integration does not support Azure DevOps Server (on-premise). Instead, you can [import a project by git URL](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url) to connect to an Azure DevOps Server.
