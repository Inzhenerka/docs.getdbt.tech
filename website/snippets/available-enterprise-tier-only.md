:::caution Available for dbt Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise+

Connecting an Azure DevOps cloud account is available for organizations using the dbt Cloud Enterprise or Enterprise+ plans. 

dbt Cloud's native Azure DevOps integration does not support Azure DevOps Server (on-premise). Instead, you can [import a project by git URL](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url) to connect to an Azure DevOps Server.
