:::info Considerations

Model governance features like model access, contracts, and versions strengthen trust and stability in your dbt project. Because they add structure, it can make it harder to roll changes back later (for example, removing model access) and increases maintenance if adopted too early.

Before adding governance features, consider whether your dbt project is ready to benefit from them. Introducing them too soon can make future changes harder if your models are still changing/evolving.
