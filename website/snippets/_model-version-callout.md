The word "version" appears in multiple places in docs site and with different meanings:
- [Model versions](/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions) &mdash; A dbt <Constant name="mesh" /> feature that enables better governance and data model management by allowing you to track changes and updates to models over time.
- [dbt_project.yml version](/reference/project-configs/version#dbt_projectyml-versions)(optional) &mdash; `dbt_project.yml` version is unrelated to <Constant name="mesh" /> and refers to the compatibility of the dbt project with a specific version of dbt.
- [.yml property file version](/reference/project-configs/version#yml-property-file-versions) - Version numbers within .yml property files inform how dbt parses those YAML files. Unrelated to <Constant name="mesh" />. (Optional since dbt v1.5) -
