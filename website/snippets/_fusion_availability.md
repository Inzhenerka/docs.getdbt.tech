<Constant name="fusion_engine" /> powers dbt development everywhere — in the [<Constant name="dbt_platform" />](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#dbt-fusion-engine), VS Code/Cursor, and locally.
Features vary by environment; see the following table and choose the best <Constant name="fusion" />-friendly setup for you:
