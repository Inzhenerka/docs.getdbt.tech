<Constant name="fusion_engine" /> powers dbt development everywhere — in the [<Constant name="dbt_platform" />](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#dbt-fusion-engine), [VS Code/Cursor](/docs/about-dbt-extension), and [locally](/docs/fusion/install-fusion-cli). <Constant name="fusion"/> in the <Constant name="dbt_platform"/> is available in private preview. Contact your account team for access.

[<Constant name="dbt_platform" />](/docs/introduction#the-dbt-platform-formerly-dbt-cloud) supports two engines: <Constant name="fusion" /> (Rust-based, fast, visual) and <Constant name="core" /> (Python-based, traditional). <Constant name="core" /> is also available as an [open-source CLI](/docs/introduction#dbt-core) for self-hosted workflows.

Features vary depending on how Fusion is implemented. Whether you’re new to dbt or already set up, check out the following table to see what solutions are available and where you can use them.
