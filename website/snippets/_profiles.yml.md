If you're using dbt from the command line, you need a `profiles.yml` file that contains the connection details for your data platform. The system reads your `dbt_project.yml` file to find the `profile` name, and then looks for a profile with the same name in your `profiles.yml` file. This profile contains all the information dbt needs to connect to your data platform.

:::note dbt platform accounts
If you're using the cloud-based <Constant name="cloud" /> platform, you can [{props.connect}](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections)[{props.setup}](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform-fusion/about-fusion-connections) directly in the <Constant name="cloud" /> interface and don't need a `profiles.yml` file.
:::

This section identifies the parts of your `profiles.yml` that aren't specific to a particular data platform. For specific connection details, refer to the relevant page for your data platform.

To add an additional target (like `prod`) to your existing `profiles.yml`, you can add another entry under the `outputs` key.


<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yml

<profile-name>:
  target: <target-name> # this is the default target
  outputs:
    <target-name>:
      type: <bigquery | postgres | redshift | snowflake | other>
      schema: <schema_identifier>
      threads: <natural_number>

      ### database-specific connection details
      ...

    <target-name>: # additional targets
      ...

<profile-name>: # additional profiles
  ...

```

</File>
