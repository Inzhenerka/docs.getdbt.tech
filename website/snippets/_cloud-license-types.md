There are three license types in dbt Cloud:

- **Developer** &mdash; User can be granted _any_ permissions.
- **Read-Only** &mdash; Available on Enterprise and Team plans only. User has read-only permissions applied to all dbt Cloud resources. Intended to view the [artifacts](/docs/deploy/artifacts) and the [deploy](/docs/deploy/deployments) section (jobs, runs, schedules) in a dbt Cloud account, but can’t make changes. _Read-only licensed users do not inherit rights from any permission sets_. Every read-only licensed user has the same access across the account, regardless of the group permissions assigned.
- **IT** &mdash; Available on Enterprise and Team plans only. User has Security Admin and Billing Admin [permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#permission-sets) applied. Can manage users, groups, and licenses, among other permissions. _IT licensed users do not inherit rights from any permission sets_. Every IT licensed user has the same access across the account, regardless of the group permissions assigned.
