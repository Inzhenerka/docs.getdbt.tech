If you are on a **Starter** plan and you're deleting users to reduce the number of billable seats, follow these steps to lower the license count to avoid being overcharged:

1. In **Account Settings**, select **Billing**. 
2. Under **Billing details**, enter the number of developer seats you want and make sure you fill in all the payment details, including the **Billing address** section. If you leave any field blank, you won't be able to save your changes.
3. Click **Update Payment Information** to save your changes.
