Remote dbt MCP tools are dependent on available dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> credits. Note that the SQL and remote Fusion tools are in this category, even when they are used and proxied through the local dbt MCP server. Most MCP tools don't consume dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> credits. However, [`text_to_sql`](#sql) usage does count toward your dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> consumption.

If you reach your dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> usage limit, all tools will be blocked until your <Constant name="copilot" /> credits reset. If you need help, please reach out to your account manager.
