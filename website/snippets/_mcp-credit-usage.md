Note that Remote dbt MCP and Fusion tools rely on dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> usage limits. Most MCP tools don't consume dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> credits. However, [`text_to_sql` and `execute_sql`](#sql) do count toward your dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> usage.

If you reach your dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> usage limit, all tools will be blocked until your <Constant name="copilot" /> credits reset. If you'd like to increase your credits, please reach out to your account manager.
