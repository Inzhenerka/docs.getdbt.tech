## Job monitoring

On the **Environments** page, there are two sections that provide an overview of the jobs for that environment:

- **In progress** &mdash; Lists the currently in progress jobs with information on when the run started
- **Top jobs by models built** &mdash; Ranks jobs by the number of models built over a specific time
