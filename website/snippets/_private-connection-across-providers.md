Private connection endpoints can't connect across cloud providers. For a private connection to work, both <Constant name="cloud" /> and the server (like {props.type}) must be hosted on the same cloud provider. For example, <Constant name="cloud" /> hosted on AWS cannot connect via PrivateLink to services hosted on Azure, and <Constant name="cloud" /> hosted on Azure can’t connect via Private Link to services hosted on AWS.
