Use the `--static-analysis` flag to override model-level `static_analysis` behavior for a single run. This flag applies to the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> only; it is ignored by <Constant name="core" />.

Values:

- `off`: Disable static analysis for all models in the run.
- `unsafe`: Use JIT ("unsafe") static analysis for all models in the run.

If not set, Fusion uses its defaults: AOT static analysis (`on`) for eligible models and JIT ("unsafe") for introspective branches. See [Configuring `static_analysis`](/docs/fusion/new-concepts#configuring-static_analysis).

<File name='Usage'>

```shell
dbt run --static-analysis off
dbt run --static-analysis unsafe
```
