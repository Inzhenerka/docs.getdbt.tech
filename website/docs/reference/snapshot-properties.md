In dbt v1.9 and later, snapshots are defined and configured in YAML files within your `snapshots/` directory (as defined by the [`snapshot-paths` config](/reference/project-configs/snapshot-paths)). Snapshot properties are declared within these YAML files, allowing you to define both the snapshot configurations and properties in one place.

</VersionBlock>

We recommend that you put them in the `snapshots/` directory. You can name these files `whatever_you_want.yml`, and nest them arbitrarily deeply in subfolders within the `snapshots/` or `models/` directory.
