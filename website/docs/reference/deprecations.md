title: "Deprecations"
---

As dbt runs, dbt generates [events](/reference/events-logging). Sometimes these events are _deprecations_. Deprecations are a special type of warning. Deprecation warnings exist to let you know that there are problems in parts of your project that will be breaking in a future version of dbt. It is important that if there are deprecation warnings in your project, time is taken to resolve them.

## List of Deprecation Warnings

### ConfigDataPathDeprecation

#### Description

In [dbt 1.0](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/Older%20versions/upgrading-to-v1.0) we renamed `data-paths` to [seed-paths](/reference/project-configs/model-paths). Getting this deprecation means that `data-paths` is still being used in your project's `dbt_project.yml`.

#### Resolution

Change `data-paths` to `seed-paths` in your `dbt_project.yml`.

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
23:14:58  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
The `data-paths` config has been renamed to `seed-paths`. Please update your
`dbt_project.yml` configuration to reflect this change.
```
</File>

### ConfigLogPathDeprecation

#### Description

In we used to allow specifying `log-path` in `dbt_project.yml`. We stopped allowing this in [dbt 1.5](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/Older%20versions/upgrading-to-v1.5). Getting this deprecation warning means that `log-path` is still specified in your `dbt_project.yml` and it's not set to the default value `logs`.

#### Resolution

Remove `log-path` from your `dbt_project.yml` and specify it via either the CLI flag `--log-path` or environment variable `DBT_LOG_PATH`  [as documented here](/reference/global-configs/logs#log-and-target-paths)

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
23:39:18  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
The `log-path` config in `dbt_project.yml` has been deprecated, and will no
longer be supported in a future version of dbt-core. If you wish to write dbt
logs to a custom directory, please use the --log-path CLI flag or DBT_LOG_PATH
env var instead.
```
</File>

### ConfigSourcePathDeprecation

#### Description

In [dbt 1.0](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/Older%20versions/upgrading-to-v1.0) we renamed `source-paths` to [model-paths](/reference/project-configs/model-paths). Getting this deprecation means that `source-paths` is still being used in your project's `dbt_project.yml`.

#### Resolution

Change `source-paths` to `model-paths` in your `dbt_project.yml`.

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
23:03:47  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
The `source-paths` config has been renamed to `model-paths`. Please update your
`dbt_project.yml` configuration to reflect this change.
23:03:47  Registered adapter: postgres=1.9.0

### ConfigTargetPathDeprecation

#### Description

In we used to allow specifying `target-path` in `dbt_project.yml`. We stopped allowing this in [dbt 1.5](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/Older%20versions/upgrading-to-v1.5). Getting this deprecation warning means that `target-path` is still specified in your `dbt_project.yml` and it's not set to the default value `target`.

#### Resolution

Remove `target-path` from your `dbt_project.yml` and specify it via either the CLI flag `--target-path` or environment variable `DBT_TARGET_PATH`  [as documented here](/reference/global-configs/logs#log-and-target-paths)

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
23:22:01  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
The `target-path` config in `dbt_project.yml` has been deprecated, and will no
longer be supported in a future version of dbt-core. If you wish to write dbt
artifacts to a custom directory, please use the --target-path CLI flag or
DBT_TARGET_PATH env var instead.
```
</File>

### ExposureNameDeprecation

#### Description

In [dbt 1.3](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/Older%20versions/upgrading-to-v1.3#new-and-changed-documentation) we began only allowing letters, numbers, and underscores in the `name` property of [exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/exposure-properties).

#### Resolution

Ensure your exposure names only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. A more human readable name can be put in the `label` property of exposures.

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
23:55:00  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
Starting in v1.3, the 'name' of an exposure should contain only letters,
numbers, and underscores. Exposures support a new property, 'label', which may
contain spaces, capital letters, and special characters. stg_&customers does not
follow this pattern. Please update the 'name', and use the 'label' property for
a human-friendly title. This will raise an error in a future version of
dbt-core.
```
</File>

### PackageInstallPathDeprecation

#### Description

We updated the default location that packages are installed when running `dbt deps` from `dbt_modules` to `dbt_packages`. During a `dbt clean` we detected that `dbt_modules` is defined in the [clean-targets](/reference/project-configs/clean-targets) property in `dbt_project.yml` even though `dbt_modules` is not the [`packages-install-path`](/reference/project-configs/packages-install-path).

#### Resolution

We recommend either of the following:
1. replace `dbt_modules` with `dbt_packages` in your `clean-targets` spec (and also `.gitignore`).
2. set `packages-install-path: dbt_modules` if you want to keep having packages install in `dbt_modules`.

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
22:48:01  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
        The default package install path has changed from `dbt_modules` to
`dbt_packages`.         Please update `clean-targets` in `dbt_project.yml` and
check `.gitignore` as well.         Or, set `packages-install-path: dbt_modules`
if you'd like to keep the current value.
```
</File>

### PackageRedirectDeprecation

#### Description

A `PackageRedirectDeprecation` means that a package currently used in your project, defined in packages.yml, has been renamed. This generally happens when the ownership of a package has changed or the scope of the package has changed. It is likely that the package currently referenced in your packages.yml will stop being actively maintained (as development has been moved to the new package name). Thus, at some point the named package you are using will likely cease working with dbt.

#### Resolution

Begin referencing the new package in your `packages.yml` instead of the old package.

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
22:31:38  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
The `fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils` package is deprecated in favor of
`dbt-labs/dbt_utils`. Please update your `packages.yml` configuration to use
`dbt-labs/dbt_utils` instead.
```
</File>

### ProjectFlagsMovedDeprecation

#### Description

The `config` property that had been setable in `profiles.yml` was [deprecated in dbt 1.8](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/upgrading-to-v1.8#quick-hits) in favor of `flags` in the `dbt_project.yaml`. If you are seeing this deprecation it means that we detected the `config` in your `profiles.yml`.

#### Resolution

Remove `config` from `profiles.yml`. Additionally add any previous `config` in `profiles.yml` to `flags` in `dbt_project.yml` [as documented here](/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs).

#### Example Event

<File name='CLI'>
```bash
00:08:12  [WARNING]: Deprecated functionality

User config should be moved from the 'config' key in profiles.yml to the 'flags' key in dbt_project.yml.
```
