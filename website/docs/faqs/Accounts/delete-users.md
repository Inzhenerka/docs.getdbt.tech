To delete a user in <Constant name="cloud" />, you must be an account owner or have admin privileges. If the user has a `developer` license type, this will open up their seat for another user or allow the admins to lower the total number of seats. 

1. From <Constant name="cloud" />, click on your account name in the left side menu and, select **Account settings**.

2. In **Account settings**, select **Users** under **Teams**.
3. Select the user you want to delete, then click **Edit**. 
4. Click **Delete** in the bottom left. Click **Confirm Delete** to immediately delete the user without additional password prompts. This action cannot be undone. However, you can re-invite the user with the same information if the deletion was made in error.

If you are on a **Starter** plan and you are deleting users to reduce the number of billable seats, you also need to take these steps to lower the license count:
1. In **Account settings**, select **Billing**. 
2. Under **Billing details**, enter the number of developer seats you want and make sure you fill in all the payment details, including the **Billing address** section. If you leave any field blank, you won't be able to save your changes.
3. Click **Update Payment Information** to save your changes.
