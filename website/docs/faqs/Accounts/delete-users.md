To delete a user in <Constant name="cloud" />, you must be an account owner or have admin privileges. If the user has a `developer` license type, this will open up their seat for another user or allow the admins to lower the total number of seats. 

1. From <Constant name="cloud" />, click on your account name in the left side menu and, select **Account settings**.

2. In **Account Settings**, select **Users** under **Teams**.
3. Select the user you want to delete, then click **Edit**. 
4. Click **Delete** in the bottom left. Click **Confirm Delete** to immediately delete the user without additional password prompts. This action cannot be undone. However, you can re-invite the user with the same information if the deletion was made in error.
