description: Learn why an indirectly referenced upstream public models don't appear in Explorer

For [project dependencies](/docs/collaborate/govern/project-dependencies) in dbt Mesh, [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-multiple-projects) only displays directly referenced [public models](/docs/collaborate/govern/model-access) from upstream projects, even if an upstream model indirectly depends on another public model.

So for example, if:

- `project_b` adds `project_a` as a dependency
- `project_b`'s model `downstream_c` references `project_a.upstream_b`
- `project_a.upstream_b` references another public model, `project_a.upstream_a`

Then:

- In Explorer, only directly referenced public models (`upstream_b` in this case) appear. Expanded upstream lineage might be available in the future.
- In the [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) lineage view, however, `upstream_a` (the indirect dependency) _will_ appear because the dbt Cloud dynamically resolves the full dependency graph.

This behavior makes sure that Explorer only shows the immediate dependencies available to that specific project.
