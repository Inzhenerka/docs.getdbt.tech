description: "Add a repository when seeing IDE unknown error"
sidebar_label: 'Receiving unknown error in the IDE'

If you're seeing the following error when you launch the <Constant name="cloud_ide" />, it could be due to a few scenarios but, commonly, it indicates a missing repository:

```shell

Your <Constant name="cloud_ide" /> session experienced an unknown error and was terminated. Please contact support.

```

You can try to resolve this by adding a repository like a [managed repository](/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository) or your preferred <Constant name="git" /> account. To add your <Constant name="git" /> account, navigate to **Project** > **Repository** and select your repository.


If you're still running into this error, please contact the Support team at support@getdbt.com for help.
