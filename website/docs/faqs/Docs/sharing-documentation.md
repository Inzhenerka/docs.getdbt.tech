If you're using <Constant name="cloud" /> to deploy your project and have a [Starter, Enterprise, or Enterprise+ plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/), you can use <Constant name="explorer" /> to view your project's [resources](/docs/build/projects) (such as models, tests, and metrics) and their <Term id="data-lineage">lineage</Term> to gain a better understanding of its latest production state. 

Access <Constant name="explorer" /> in <Constant name="cloud" /> by clicking the **Explore** link in the navigation. You can have up to 5 read-only users access the documentation for your project.

<Constant name="cloud" /> developer plan and <Constant name="core" /> users can use [dbt Docs](/docs/explore/build-and-view-your-docs#dbt-docs), which generates basic documentation but it doesn't offer the same speed, metadata, or visibility as <Constant name="explorer" />.
