## What is dbt Mesh?

import Mesh from '/snippets/_what-is-mesh.md';

<Mesh feature={'/snippets/_what-is-mesh.md'} />

<Constant name="cloud" /> is designed to coordinate the features above and simplify the complexity to solve for these problems.

If you're just starting your dbt journey, don't worry about building a multi-project architecture right away. You can _incrementally_ adopt the features in this guide as you scale. The collection of features work effectively as independent tools. Familiarizing yourself with the tooling and features that make up a multi-project architecture, and how they can apply to your organization will help you make better decisions as you grow.

For additional information, refer to the [<Constant name="mesh" /> FAQs](/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs).

## Learning goals

- Understand the **purpose and tradeoffs** of building a multi-project architecture.
- Develop an intuition for various **<Constant name="mesh" /> patterns** and how to design a multi-project architecture for your organization.
- Establish recommended steps to **incrementally adopt** these patterns in your dbt implementation.
