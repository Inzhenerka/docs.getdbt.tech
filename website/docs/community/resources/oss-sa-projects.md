# Open source and source-available projects

Looking for a good place to get involved contributing code? dbt Labs supports the following repositories, organized by the language primarily needed for contribution:

## Rust

- [<Constant name="fusion_engine" />](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion) - the next-generation engine powering dbt

## Python

- [<Constant name="core" />](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) - the original engine powering dbt
- [hubcap](https://github.com/dbt-labs/hubcap) - the code powering the dbt Package hub

## dbt

- [dbt Labs' packages](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/) - the dbt pacakges created and supported by dbt Labs. Packages are just dbt projects, so if you know the SQL, Jinja, and YAML necessary to work in dbt, you can contribute to packages.

## YAML and JSON Config

- [dbt-jsonschema](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-jsonschema) - powering completion and linting for YAML configuration in dbt projects.

## Shell

- [dbt-completion.bash](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-completion.bash) - provides shell completion of CLI commands and selectors such as models and tests for bash and zsh.
