# dbt platform configuration checklist <Lifecycle status="self_service,managed,managed_plus" />

So, you've created a new cloud-hosted dbt platform account, and you're ready to explore its lightning-fast and intuitive features. Welcome! Before you begin, let’s ensure your account is properly configured so that you can easily onboard new users and take advantage of all the integrations dbt has to offer. 

For most organizations, this will require some collaboration with IT and/or security teams. Depending on the features you're using, you may need some of the following admin personas to help you get set up:
- Data warehouse
- Azure/Entra ID
- Google Workspace
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Okta 
- SAML provider
- Git 

This checklist is designed to ensure you have everything in the right place, allowing you to deploy quickly and without any bottlenecks. 

## Data warehouse

The dbt platform supports [global connections](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections#connection-management) for your data warehouses. This means that a single configured connection can be used across multiple projects and environments. The dbt platform supports multiple data warehouse connections, including (but not limited to) BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, and Snowflake. One of the earliest account configuration steps you'll want to take is ensuring you have a working connection:

- [ ] Use the [connection set up documentation](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections) to configure the data warehouse connection of your choice. 
- [ ] Be sure the data warehouse has real data you can reference. This can be production or development data. We have a sandbox e-commerce project called [The Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) that you can use if you prefer. The Jaffle Shop includes mock data and ready-to-run models!
- [ ] Whether starting a brand new project or importing an existing dbt Core project, you'll want to make sure you have the [proper structure configured](/docs/build/projects).
    - [ ] If you are migrating from Core, there are some important things you'll need to know, so check out our [migration guide](/guides/core-cloud-2?step=1).
- [ ] Your users will need to [configure their credentials](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud#get-started-with-the-cloud-ide) to connect to the development environment in the dbt Studio IDE.
    - [ ] Ensure that all users who need access to work in the IDE have a [developer license](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) assigned in your account. 
- [ ] dbt models are primarily written as [SELECT statements](/docs/build/sql-models), so an early step for measuring success is having a developer run a simple select statement in the IDE and validating the results. 
    - [ ] You can also verify the connection by running basic SQL queries using [dbt Insights](/docs/explore/access-dbt-insights).
- [ ] Create a single model and ensure that you can [run it](/reference/dbt-commands) successfully. 
    - [ ] For an easy to use drag-and-drop interface, try creating it with [dbt Canvas](/docs/cloud/canvas).
- [ ] Verify that dbt developers have proper roles and access in your data warehouse(s).
- [ ] Create a service account with proper access for your [production jobs](/docs/deploy/jobs).

## Git configuration

Git is, for many dbt environments, the backbone of your project. Git repositories are where your dbt files will live and where your developers will collaborate and manage version control of your project. 

- [ ] Configure a [Git repository](/docs/cloud/git/git-configuration-in-dbt-cloud) for your account. dbt supports integrations with:
    - [GitHub](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github)
    - [GitLab](/docs/cloud/git/connect-gitlab)
    - [Azure DevOps](/docs/cloud/git/connect-azure-devops)
    - Other providers using [Git clone](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url)
    - If you aren't ready to integrate with an existing Git solution, dbt can provide you with a [managed Git repository](/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository). 
- [ ] Developers are able to [checkout](/docs/cloud/git/version-control-basics#git-overview) a new branch in your repo.
- [ ] Developers in the IDE can [commit changes](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/ide-user-interface#basic-layout). 

## Environments and jobs

[Environments](/docs/environments-in-dbt) separate your development data from your production data. There are two types of environments - `Deployment` and `Development`. Within that distinction, there are three types of `Deployment` environments available on the dbt platform:
- Production - One per project
- Staging - One per project
- General - As many as you need per project
Additionally, you will have only one `Development` environment per project, but each developer will have their own unique access to the IDE, separate from the work of other developers. 

[Jobs](/docs/deploy/jobs) dictate which commands are run in your environments and can be triggered manually, on a schedule, by other jobs, by APIs, or when pull requests are committed or merged. 

Once your data warehouse is connected and Git integration is complete, it's time to configure environments and jobs:

- [ ] Start by creating a new [development environment](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#create-a-development-environment) for your project. 
- [ ] Create a [Production deployment environment](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments).
    - [ ] (Optional) Create an additional Staging or General environment.
- [ ] [Create and schedule](/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs#create-and-schedule-jobs) a deployment job. 
    - [ ] Validate the job by manually running it first.
- [ ] If needed, configure different databases for your environments.

## User access

The dbt platform offers a variety of access control tools that you can leverage to grant or revoke user access, configure RBAC, and assign user licenses and permissions.

- [ ] Manually [invite users](/docs/cloud/manage-access/invite-users) to the dbt platform, and they can authenticate using [MFA (SMS or authenticator app)](/docs/cloud/manage-access/mfa).
- [ ] Configure [single sign-on or OAuth](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) for advanced access control. <Lifecycle status="managed,managed_plus" /> accounts only. 
    - [ ] Create [SSO mappings](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#sso-mappings-) for groups
- [ ] Users should be able to connect to the data warehouse from their personal profile. 
- [ ] [Create groups](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#create-new-groups-) with granular permission sets assigned.
- [ ] Create [RBAC rules](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#role-based-access-control-) to assign users to groups and permission sets upon sign in. <Lifecycle status="managed,managed_plus" /> accounts only. 
- [ ] Enforce SSO for all non-admin users, and MFA is enforced for all password-based logins. 

## Continue the journey 

Once you've completed this checklist, you're ready to start your dbt platform journey, but that journey has only just begun. The docs in these pages will help you get the most out of what dbt has to offer, but there are other resources to aid you along the way:
- [ ] The [guides](/guides) offer quickstarts for warehouse connections and project features.
- [ ] [dbt Learn](https://learn.getdbt.com/catalog) has hands on courses and interactive content.
- [ ] Our [best practices](/best-practices) offer practical advice on structuring and deploying dbt projects.
- [ ] The [references](/reference/references-overview) are the product dictionary and offer detailed implementation examples.
