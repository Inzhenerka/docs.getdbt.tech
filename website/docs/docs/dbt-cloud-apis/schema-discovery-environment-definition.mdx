The definition object allows you to query the logical state of a given project node given its most recent manifest generated models.

The [Example queries](#example-queries) illustrate a few fields you can query with this `definition` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.


### Example queries

You can use your production environment's `id`:

```graphql
query Example {
	environment(id: 834){ # Get the latest state of the production environment
		definition { # The logical state of a given project node given its most recent manifest generated
			models(first: 100, filter:{access:public}){ # Filter on model access (or other properties)
				edges { node {
					rawCode, # Compare to see if/how the model has changed since the last build
					jobDefinitionId, runGeneratedAt,	# When the code was last compiled or run
					contractEnforced, group, version}}} # Model governance
		}
	}
}
```


### Fields
When querying the `definition` field of `environment`, you can use the following fields.
<SchemaTable nodeName="DefinitionState" />
