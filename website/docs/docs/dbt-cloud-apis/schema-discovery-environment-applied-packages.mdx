[dbt packages](/docs/build/packages) are libraries with models, macros, and other resources that tackle a specific problem area utilized by dbt projects. You can query project packages through the Discovery API.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `packages` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Arguments

When querying for `packages`, you can use the following arguments:

<NodeArgsTable parent="AppliedState" name="packages" />

### Example query

You can specify the `environmentId` and "model" as the resource to see all dbt packages in this environment that contain model resources:

```graphql
query {
  environment(id: 834) {
    applied {
      packages(resource: "model")
    }
  }
}
```
