[Seeds](/docs/build/seeds) are CSV files in your dbt project that dbt can load into your data warehouse. You can query seeds through the Discovery API.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `seeds` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Arguments

When querying for `seeds`, you can use the following arguments:

<NodeArgsTable parent="AppliedState" name="seeds" />

### Example query

You can specify the `environmentId`, filter by the database, and limit to the first 100 to show information about the first 100 seed files in the `analytics` database, including their metadata and file locations:

```graphql
query ($environmentId: BigInt!, $first: Int!, $filter: GenericMaterializedFilter) {
  environment(id: $environmentId) {
    applied {
      seeds(
        first: 100,
        filter: {
          database: "analytics"
        }
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            description
            name
            filePath
            projectId
            fqn
            tags
            uniqueId
            resourceType
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

When querying for `seeds`, you can use the following fields:

<SchemaTable nodeName="SeedAppliedStateNodeConnection" />

### Key fields from nodes

<SchemaTable nodeName="SeedAppliedStateNode" />
