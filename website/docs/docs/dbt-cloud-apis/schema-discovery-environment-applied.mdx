import { SchemaTable } from "./schema";

The applied object allows you to query information about a particular model based on `environmentId`.

The [Example queries](#example-queries) illustrate a few fields you can query with this `environment` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.


### Example queries

You can use your production environment's `id`:

```graphql
query Example {
	environment(id: 834){ # Get the latest state of the production environment
		applied { # The state of an executed node as it exists as an object in the database
			models(first: 100){ # Pagination to ensure manageable response for large projects
				edges { node {
					uniqueId, name, description, rawCode, compiledCode, # Basic properties
					database, schema, alias, # Table/view identifier (can also filter by)
					executionInfo {executeCompletedAt, executionTime}, # Metadata from when the model was built
					tests {name, executionInfo{lastRunStatus, lastRunError}}, # Latest test results
					catalog {columns {name, description, type}, stats {label, value}}, # Catalog info
					ancestors(types:[Source]) {name, ...on SourceAppliedStateNestedNode {freshness{maxLoadedAt, freshnessStatus}}}, # Source freshness }
					children {name, resourceType}}} # Immediate dependencies in lineage
				totalCount } # Number of models in the project
		}
	}
}
```



### Fields

When querying the `applied` field of `environment`, you can use the following fields.
<SchemaTable nodeName="AppliedState" />
