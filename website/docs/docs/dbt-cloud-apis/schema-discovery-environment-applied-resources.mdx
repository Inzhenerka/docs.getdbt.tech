The resources object allows you to paginate across all resources in your environment.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `resources` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Arguments

When querying for `resources`, you can use the following arguments:

<NodeArgsTable parent="AppliedState" name="resources" />

### Example query

You can specify the `environmentId`, filter by "Model" as the type, and limit to the first 100 results to see comprehensive information about the first 100 model resources in this environment, including their metadata, tags, and file locations:

```graphql
query {
  environment(id: 834) {
    applied {
      resources(
        filter: {
          types: [
            Model
          ]
        }, 
        first: 100
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            accountId
            description
            environmentId
            filePath

            projectId
            resourceType
            uniqueId
            tags
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
