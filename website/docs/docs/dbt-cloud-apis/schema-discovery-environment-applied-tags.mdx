[Tags](/reference/resource-configs/tags) provide a mechanism to categorize and group resources within a dbt project, enabling selective execution and management of these resources. You can query tags through the Discovery API.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `tags` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.
 

### Example query

You can use the `environmentId` to return the name of all the tags in your environment:

```graphql
query {
  environment(id: 834) {
    applied {
      tags {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

When querying for `tags`, you can use the following fields:

<SchemaTable nodeName="Tag" />
