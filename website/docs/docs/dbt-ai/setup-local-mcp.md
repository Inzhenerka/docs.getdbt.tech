# Set up local MCP <Lifecycle status="beta" />

[The local dbt MCP server](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp) runs locally on your machine. Set up the local dbt MCP server with the following directions: 

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to be able to run `dbt-mcp` and [related dependencies](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp/blob/main/pyproject.toml) into an isolated virtual environment.

2. Create an `.env` file to set your environment variables. You will need to configure environment variables to access the tools. If you are only using the dbt CLI commands, you do not need to supply the dbt platform-specific environment variables, and vice versa.

    <TabItem value="Sample file">
      Here is an example of the file:

        ```code
        DBT_HOST=cloud.getdbt.com
        DBT_PROD_ENV_ID=your-production-environment-id
        DBT_DEV_ENV_ID=your-development-environment-id
        DBT_USER_ID=your-user-id
        DBT_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
        DBT_TOKEN=your-service-token
        DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/dbt/project
        DBT_PATH=/path/to/your/dbt/executable
        MULTICELL_ACCOUNT_PREFIX=your-account-prefix
        ```
      You will need this file for integrating with MCP-compatible tools.
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="API and SQL tool settings">
      | Environment Variable | Required | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | DBT_HOST | Required | Your dbt platform [instance hostname](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses). If you're using Multi-cell, exclude the `ACCOUNT_PREFIX` from the hostname. The default is `cloud.getdbt.com`  |
      | MULTICELL_ACCOUNT_PREFIX | Only required for Multi-cell instances | Set your Multi-cell  `ACCOUNT_PREFIX`. If you are not using Multi-cell, don't set this value. You can learn more about regions and hosting [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses).  |
      | DBT_TOKEN | Required | Your personal access token or service token from the dbt platform. <br/>**Note**: When using the Semantic Layer, it is recommended to use a personal access token. If you're using a service token, make sure that it has at least `Semantic Layer Only`, `Metadata Only`, and `Developer` permissions.  |
      | DBT_ACCOUNT_ID | Required for Admininstrative API tools | Your [dbt account ID](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Accounts/find-user-id) |
      | DBT_PROD_ENV_ID | Required | Your dbt Cloud production environment ID |
      | DBT_DEV_ENV_ID | Optional | Your dbt Cloud development environment ID |
      | DBT_USER_ID | Optional | Your dbt Cloud user ID ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Accounts/find-user-id)) |
        </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="dbt CLI settings">
      The local dbt-mcp supports all flavors of dbt, including dbt Core and the dbt Fusion engine.

      | Environment Variable | Required | Description | Example |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | DBT_PROJECT_DIR | Required | The path to where the repository of your dbt project is hosted locally.  | /Users/myname/reponame |
      | DBT_PATH | Required | The path to your dbt executable (Core/Fusion/Cloud CLI). You can find your dbt executable by running `which dbt` | /opt/homebrew/bin/dbt |
      | DBT_CLI_TIMEOUT | Optional | Configure the number of seconds before your agent will timeout dbt CLI commands.  | Defaults to 60 seconds. |

      You can set any environment variable supported by your dbt executable, like [for the ones supported in dbt Core](/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs#available-flags). dbt MCP respects the standard environment variables and flags for usage tracking mentioned [here](/reference/global-configs/usage-stats).

      `DBT_WARN_ERROR_OPTIONS='{"error": ["NoNodesForSelectionCriteria"]}'` is automatically set so that the MCP server knows if no node is selected when running a dbt command.
      You can overwrite it if needed, but it provides a better experience when calling dbt from the MCP server, ensuring the tool selects valid nodes.
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Disabling tools">
      You can disable the following tool access on the local `dbt-mcp`:

      | Name                     | Default | Description                                                                     |
      | ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
      | `DISABLE_DBT_CLI`        | `false` | Set this to `true` to disable dbt Core, dbt Cloud CLI, and dbt Fusion MCP tools |
      | `DISABLE_SEMANTIC_LAYER` | `false` | Set this to `true` to disable dbt Semantic Layer MCP tools                    |
      | `DISABLE_DISCOVERY`      | `false` | Set this to `true` to disable dbt Discovery API MCP tools                     |
      | `DISABLE_ADMIN_API`      | `false` | Set this to `true` to disable dbt Admininistrative API MCP tools                         |
      | `DISABLE_SQL`            | `true`  | Set this to `false` to enable SQL MCP tools                                |
      | `DISABLE_DBT_CODEGEN`    | `true`  | Set this to `false` to enable dbt codegen MCP tools (requires dbt-codegen package) |
      | `DISABLE_TOOLS`          | ""      | Set this to a list of tool names delimited by a `,` to disable specific tools    |
    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

3. (Optional) Test your configuration:

    In a terminal, run the following command to test your setup:
    ```bash
    uvx --env-file <path-to-.env-file> dbt-mcp
    ```

    If there are no errors, `uv` and the `.env` file are set up correctly and you can move on to the next step.

4. Set up your MCP client:

    After creating your `.env` file, you can move on to our guides on connecting dbt-mcp to tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor or to creating aconfiguration file. This is dependent on what tools you want to integrate with.


    #### Example configuration
    For some tools,  you may need an additional configuration file to upload to connect to dbt-mcp.
    Here is a sample configuration JSON file that you can use to connect to the MCP tools. Be sure to replace the sections within `<>`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "dbt-mcp": {
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": [
            "--env-file",
            "<path-to-.env-file>",
            "dbt-mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    `<path-to-.env-file>` is where you saved the `.env` file from the Setup step.
