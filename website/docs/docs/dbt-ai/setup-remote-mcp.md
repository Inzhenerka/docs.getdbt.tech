# Set up remote MCP <Lifecycle status="self_service,managed,managed_plus,beta" />

The remote server uses an HTTP connection and makes calls to dbt-mcp hosted on the cloud-based dbt platform.

:::info
Note that Remote dbt MCP and Fusion tools rely on dbt Copilot usage limits. Most MCP tools don't consume dbt Copilot credits, however [`text_to_sql` and `execute_sql`](#sql) do count toward your dbt Copilot usage.

If you reach your dbt Copilot usage limit, all tools will be blocked until your Copilot credits resets. If you'd like to increase your credits, please reach out to your account manager. 
:::

1. Ensure that you have [AI Features](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/enable-dbt-copilot) turned on.
2. Obtain the following information from dbt Platform:

  - **dbt Cloud host**: Use this to form the full URL. For example, replace `<host>` here: `https://<host>/api/ai/v1/mcp/`. It may look like: `https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/ai/v1/mcp/`. If you have a multi-cell account, the host URL will be in the `<ACCOUNT_PREFIX>.us1.dbt.com` format. For more information, [check out our docs.](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses)
  - **Production environment ID**: This can be found on the `Orchestration` page of dbt Cloud. Use this to set an `x-dbt-prod-environment-id` header.
  - **Token**: Please generate either a personal access token or a service token. In terms of permissions, to fully utilize remote MCP, it must be configured with Semantic Layer and Developer permissions.

3. For the remote MCP, you will pass on headers through the JSON blob to configure required fields:

  **Configuration for APIs and SQL tools**

  | Header | Required | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Token | Required | Your personal access token or service token from the dbt platform. <br/> **Note**: When using the Semantic Layer, it is recommended to use a personal access token. If you're using a service token, make sure that it has at least `Semantic Layer Only`, `Metadata Only`, and `Developer` permissions. |
  | x-dbt-prod-environment-id | Required | Your dbt Cloud production environment ID |

  **Additional configuration for SQL tools**
  | Header | Required | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | x-dbt-dev-environment-id | Required for `execute_sql` | Your dbt Cloud development environment ID |
  | x-dbt-user-id | Required for `execute_sql` | Your dbt Cloud user ID ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Accounts/find-user-id)) |

  **Additional configuration for Fusion tools**

Fusion tools, by default, defer to the environment provided via `x-dbt-prod-environment-id` for model and table metadata.

  | Header | Required | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | x-dbt-dev-environment-id | Required| Your dbt platform development environment ID |
  | x-dbt-user-id | Required | Your dbt platform user ID ([docs](/faqs/Accounts/find-user-id)) |
  | x-dbt-fusion-disable-defer | Optional | Default: `false`. When set to `true`, fusion tools will not defer to the production environment and use the models and table metadata from the development environment (`x-dbt-dev-environment-id`) instead. |


  **Configuration to disable tools**
  | Header | Required  | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | x-dbt-disable-tools | Optional | A comma-separated list of tools to disable. For instance: `get_all_models,text_to_sql,list_entities` |
  | x-dbt-disable-toolsets | Optional | A comma-separated list of toolsets to disable. For instance: `semantic_layer,sql,discovery` |

4. After establishing which headers you need, you can follow the examples [here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp/tree/main/examples) to create your own agent. 

The MCP protocol is programming language and framework agnostic, so use whatever helps you build agents. Alternatively, you can connect the remote dbt MCP server to MCP clients that support header-based authentication. You can use this example Cursor configuration, replacing `<host>`, `<token>`, `<prod-id>`, `<user-id>`, and `<dev-id>` with your information:

  ```
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "dbt": {
        "url": "https://<host>/api/ai/v1/mcp/",
        "headers": {
         "Authorization": "token <token>",
          "x-dbt-prod-environment-id": "<prod-id>",
          "x-dbt-user-id": "<user-id>",
          "x-dbt-dev-environment-id": "<dev-id>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
