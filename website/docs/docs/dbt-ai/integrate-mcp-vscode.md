# Integrate VS Code with MCP <Lifecycle status="beta" />

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp) is a powerful and popular integrated development environment (IDE). 

These instructions are for integrating dbt MCP and VS Code. To get started, in VS Code:

1. Open the Settings menu and select the correct tab atop the page for your use case
    - `Workspace` &mdash; configures the server in the context of your workspace
    - `User` &mdash; configures the server in the context of your user 
    <br />
   **Note for WSL users**: If you're using VS Code with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you'll need to configure WSL-specific settings. Run the **Preferences: Open Remote Settings** command from the Command Palette (F1) or select the **Remote** tab in the Settings editor. Local User settings are reused in WSL but can be overridden with WSL-specific settings. Configuring MCP servers in the local user settings will not work properly in a WSL environment.

2. Select **Features** → **Chat**

3. Ensure that "MCP" is **Enabled**

4. Open the command palette `Control/Command + Shift + P`, and select either `MCP: Open Workspace Folder MCP Configuration` or `MCP: Open User Configuration`, depending on whether you want to install the MCP server for this workspace or all workspaces for the user

5. Add your server configuration (`dbt`) to the provided `mcp.json` file as one of the servers:

  <Tabs>

  <TabItem value="Local MCP server">

  ```json
  {
    "servers": {
      "dbt": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "--env-file",
          "<path-to-.env-file>",
          "dbt-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  `<path-to-.env-file>` is where you saved the `.env` file from the Setup step

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Remote MCP server">


  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
     "dbt": {
        "url": "https://<host>/api/ai/v1/mcp/",
       "headers": {
          "Authorization": "token <token>",
          "x-dbt-prod-environment-id": "<prod-id>",
       }
     }
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

6. You can start, stop, and configure your MCP servers by:
  - Running the `MCP: List Servers` command from the Command Palette (Control/Command + Shift + P) and selecting the server. 

  - Utilizing the keywords inline within the `mcp.json` file:

Now you will be able to access the local dbt MCP server on VS Code through interfaces like Github Copilot.
