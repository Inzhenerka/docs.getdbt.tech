# Orchestrate exposures <Lifecycle status="enterprise,beta" />

<IntroText>

Use dbt [Cloud job scheduler](/docs/deploy/job-scheduler) to proactively refresh downstream exposures and the underlying data sources (extracts) that power your Tableau Workbooks.

</IntroText>

:::tip Available in private beta
Orchestrating exposures is currently available in private beta to dbt Cloud Enterprise accounts. To join the beta, contact your account representative.
:::

Orchestrating exposures integrates with [downstream exposures](/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau) and uses your `dbt build` job to ensure that Tableau extracts are updated regularly.

Control the frequency of these refreshes by configuring environment variables in your dbt environment.

## Prerequisites

To orchestrate downstream exposures, you should meet the following:

- [Configured downstream exposures](/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau) and the desired exposures are included in your lineage.
- Your environment and jobs are on a supported [release track](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) dbt.
- Have a dbt Cloud account on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/).
- Have set up a [production](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#set-as-production-environment) deployment environment for each project you want to explore, with at least one successful job run. 
- Have [admin permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions) in dbt Cloud to edit project settings or production environment settings.

## Orchestrate downstream exposures

To orchestrate downstream exposures and see the refresh happen automatically during scheduled dbt jobs:

1. In the dbt Cloud, click **Deploy**, then **Environments**, and select the **Environment variables** tab.
2. Click **Add variable** and set the [environment level variable](/docs/build/environment-variables#setting-and-overriding-environment-variables) `DBT_ACTIVE_EXPOSURES` to `1` within the environment you want the refresh to happen.
3. Then set the `DBT_ACTIVE_EXPOSURES_BUILD_AFTER` to control the maximum refresh frequency (in minutes) you want between each exposure refresh.
4. Set the variable to **1440** minutes (24 hours) by default. This means that downstream exposures won’t refresh Tableau extracts more often than this set interval, even if the related models run more frequently.

5. Run a job in production. You will see the update each time a job runs in production. 
   - If a job runs before the set interval has passed, dbt Cloud skips the downstream exposure refresh and marks it as `skipped` in the job logs.
6. View the downstream exposure logs in the dbt run job logs.
