:::warning Disclaimer
This adapter is in the Alpha product stage and is not production-ready. It should only be used in sandbox or test environments. 

As we continue to develop and take in your feedback, the experience is subject to change &mdash; commands, configuration, and workflows may be updated or removed in future releases. 
:::

This `dbt-salesforce` adapter is available via CLI in the <Constant name="fusion_engine" />. To access the adapter, [install dbt Fusion](/docs/fusion/about-fusion-install). We recommend using the [VS Code Extension](/docs/fusion/install-dbt-extension) as the development interface. <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> support coming soon. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect dbt to the Salesforce Data Cloud, you need the following:

- A Data Cloud instance
- [An external client app that dbt connects to for the Data Cloud instance](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.create_a_local_external_client_app.htm&type=5), with [OAuth configured](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.configure_external_client_app_oauth_settings.htm&type=5). OAuth scopes must include:
  - Manage user data via APIs (`api`)
  - Perform requests at any time (`refresh_token`, `offline_access`)
  - Perform ANSI SQL queries on Data Cloud data (`cdp_query_api`)
- [A private key and the `server.key` file](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.252.0.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm)
- User with `Data Cloud Admin` permission

## Configure Fusion

To connect dbt to Salesforce Data Cloud, set up your `profiles.yml`. Refer to the following configuration:

<File name='~/.dbt/profiles.yml'>

```yaml
company-name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: salesforce
      method: jwt_bearer
      client_id: [Consumer Key of your Data Cloud app]
      private_key_path: [local file path of your server key]
      login_url: "https://login.salesforce.com"
      username: [username on the Data Cloud Instance]
```
</File>


| Profile field | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `method` | Yes | Authentication Method. Currently, only `jwt_bearer` supported. | jwt_bearer |
| `client_id` | Yes | This is the `Consumer Key` from your connected app secrets. |  |
| `private_key_path` | Yes | File path of the `server.key` file in your computer. | /Users/dbt_user/Documents/server.key |
| `login_url` | Yes | Login URL of the Salesforce instance.  | [https://login.salesforce.com](https://login.salesforce.com/) |
| `username` | Yes | Username on the Data Cloud Instance. | dbt_user@dbtlabs.com |

<!--For username, the sample above says [Data cloud instance] but the sample here is an email-->
