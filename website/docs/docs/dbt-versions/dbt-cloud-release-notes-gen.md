<Constant name="cloud" /> Single-tenant release notes for weekly updates. Release notes fall into one of these categories:

- **New:** New products and features
- **Enhancement:** Performance improvements and feature enhancements
- **Fix:** Bug and security fixes
- **Behavior change:** A change to existing behavior that doesn't fit into the other categories, such as feature deprecations or changes to default settings

Release notes are grouped by date for single-tenant environments.


## December 17, 2025

### New

- **dbt platform**
  - **Feature licensing service**: A new `/accounts/<id>/feature-licenses` endpoint issues short-lived JWTs that encode entitled features, and service/PAT authentication now checks that a caller holds an active license on the target account before any Fusion-enabled workflow runs. 
  - **Databricks platform metadata credentials**: Databricks warehouses can register platform metadata credentials (token plus optional catalog), enabling catalog ingestion, metadata sharing, and Cost Insights pipelines without custom adapters. 

### Enhancements

- **dbt platform**
  - **Large list pagination**: Settings's Projects and Credentials now paginate after 25 rows (with search boxes and skeleton states), keeping navigation responsive for large deployments.
- **Metadata Explorer**
  - **Model context & lineage polish**: Model panels now show materialization type, lineage renders metadata strips only when content exists, and upstream public-model columns load automatically for better cross-project visibility.
  - **Freshness clarity & Studio navigation**: Source tiles respect the `meta5161ExpiredUnconfiguredSources` flag (showing warn/error thresholds) and "Open in IDE" links now point at `/studio/{accountId}/projects/{projectId}` to drop users directly into dbt Studio.

- **Insights UI**
  - **Copilot guardrails**: The Copilot listener now hydrates builder tabs only when a semantic-layer payload arrives, preventing plain-SQL replies from overwriting editor state. 
- **dbt CLI**
  - **Improved monorepo support for file sync and the IDE**:
    - File sync now anchors itself to the invocation directory, making monorepo structures behave more predictably.
    - Nested `dependencies.yml` files correctly trigger dependency installs.
    - The IDE’s LSP and file sync now recognize dbt subdirectories properly.
    - Exclusion lists remain accurate even in multi-project repositories.
- **Notifications system**
  - **Webhook auditability**: Outbound calls now persist the exact JSON body in webhook history, making allowlisting and troubleshooting easier. 

- **Studio**
  - **Git sidebar & file refresh parity**: The file tree now mirrors Cloud VCS statuses (including conflicts) and automatically invalidates caches after `dbt deps`/`dbt clean`, so new or removed files appear without a reload.
  - **Log viewers & Autofix UX**: Command and interactive query logs adopt the new accordion-based viewer, and Autofix sessions in Fusion treat plain `parse` commands as the trigger for deprecation summaries, keeping remediation flows consistent.

### Fixes

- **dbt platform**
  - **Environment variable editor stability**: Editing one variable no longer backfills blank cells with previously edited values, preventing accidental overrides. 
  - **Cost optimization indicator accuracy**: Job pages once again display “Cost optimization features” whenever Fusion actually runs (and gating conditions are met), so users see the right coverage status regardless of feature-flag permutations. 

### Behavior changes

- **dbt platform**
  - **Stronger tenant identity enforcement**: Service/PAT calls without an active license now fail authentication, Slack Copilot sessions build a scoped identity JWT for the invoking user, and SSO providers enforce auto-generated slugs (draft configs can’t be targeted), reducing misconfiguration risk. 

- **dbt CLI**
  - **User-isolated invocation history**: Every invocation lookup validates the caller’s user ID, preventing admins from accidentally reading another developer’s runs when multiple accounts share a CLI server. 
- **IDE server**
  - **Enhanced security for support-assisted sessions:** Support impersonation sessions now restrict the execution of `show`, `run`, `build`, and `test` commands. Artifacts generated by `dbt show` are also short-lived and will automatically expire after 15 minutes to limit unintended data retention.

- **dbt Orchestration**
  - **Fusion compare support & new dependency**: Fusion tracks now treat `dbt compare` as a supported command (no more target-path hacks). 

## December 10, 2025

### Enhancements

- **AI codegen API**: Streaming middleware enforces request-scoped instrumentation across every AI endpoint, offload warehouse calls via threads, and expose human-readable tool names while gating keyword search behind feature flag for approved tenants.
  
- **dbt platform**
  - **Operations clarity**: Environment profile drawers link directly to connection settings and treat Snowflake fields as optional, while Compare Changes and run-step drawers now explain whether steps failed or were skipped so troubleshooting is faster.
  - **Collaboration & notifications**: Slack Copilot mentions are now more reliable, with hardened workers, support for CSV attachments, and improved logging. Webhook channels now accept longer URLs, handle “warning-only” subscriptions correctly, and automatically clean up corrupted job IDs.
  - **Profile & credential management**: Environment APIs accept `secondary_profile_ids`, run acquisition favors profile-backed credentials, and whoami/auth metrics are scrubbed so cross-platform profiles stay in sync.

- **dbt CLI server**: Improved stability and performance for large projects.
- **Studio IDE**: For dbt Fusion logging, node start and end times will now properly be displayed in command output. 
- **Studio IDE**: Copilot Chat automatically appears anywhere AI entitlements exist, preview runs auto-cancel when nodes change, and keyboard shortcuts respect native keymaps with clear UI labels. 
- **Studio IDE**: Tab view, console pane, and command drawer have been redesigned to enhance efficiency and multitasking.

### Fixes

- **Studio IDE server**: Branch creation now returns explicit feedback for bad branch names/SHAs and detects unauthorized Git errors earlier, making automation failures actionable.

## December 3, 2025

### New

- **dbt platform**
  - **Autofix deprecation warnings**: When deprecations are detected, you now see "Autofix deprecation warnings."
  - **Autofix Packages detailed results**: After running Autofix, you see a results panel with upgraded packages (with links), packages left unchanged and why, and quick access to `packages.yml` to help assess Fusion readiness and next steps.

### Enhancements

- **dbt platform**
  - **Code Quality tab improvements**
    - Clearer lint/format actions (SQLFluff, Prettier), better empty states, visible Config button when applicable, and simplified logs retrieval.
    - Applies to SQL, JSON, YAML, and Markdown workflows.  
  - **Editor experience**
    - Upgraded editor for stability.
    - Improved container sizing/overflow.
    - "Save" overlay only appears when tabs are open.
    - Minor action‑bar refinements.

### Fixes

- **dbt platform lineage and command pane stability**: Reliability improved by aligning with updated IDE and VS Code command APIs; eliminates intermittent skips.

### Behavior changes

- **dbt platform:** dbt Core “versionless” renamed to “latest” so it's consistent and clear across tenants.
