<Constant name="cloud" /> release notes for recent and historical changes. Release notes fall into one of the following categories:

- **New:** New products and features
- **Enhancement:** Performance improvements and feature enhancements
- **Fix:** Bug and security fixes
- **Behavior change:** A change to existing behavior that doesn't fit into the other categories, such as feature deprecations or changes to default settings

Release notes are grouped by month for both multi-tenant and virtual private cloud (VPC) environments.

## October 2025

- **Behavior change**: The CodeGenCodeLens feature for creating models from your sources with a click of a button has been temporarily removed from the <Constant name="cloud_ide" /> due to compatibility issues. We plan to reintroduce this feature in the near future for both the IDE and the VS Code extension.

## September 2025

- **Fix**: Improved how [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow) handles [offset metrics](/docs/build/derived) for more accurate results when querying time-based data. MetricFlow now joins data _after_ aggregation when the query grain matches the offset grain. Previously, when querying offset metrics, the offset join was applied _before_ aggregation, which could exclude some values from the total time period.

## August 2025

- **Fix**: Resolved a bug that caused [saved query](/docs/build/saved-queries) exports to fail during `dbt build` with `Unable to get saved_query` errors. 
- **New**: The <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> GraphQL API now has a [`queryRecords`](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql#query-records) endpoint. With this endpoint, you can view the query history both for Insights and <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> queries.
- **Fix**: Resolved a bug that caused <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> queries with a trailing whitespace to produce an error. This issue mostly affected [Push.ai](https://docs.push.ai/data-sources/semantic-layers/dbt) users and is fixed now. 
- **New**: You can now use [personal access tokens (PATs)](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/user-tokens) to authenticate in the Semantic Layer. This enables user-level authentication and reduces the need for sharing tokens between users. When you authenticate using PATs, queries are run using your personal development credentials. For more information, see [Set up the dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl).

## July 2025

- **New**: The [Tableau Cloud](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) integration with Semantic Layer is now available. For more information, see [Tableau](/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/tableau).
- **Preview**: The [Semantic Layer Power BI integration](/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/power-bi) is now available in Preview.
- **Enhancement:** You can now use `limit` and `order_by` parameters when creating [saved queries](/docs/build/saved-queries). 
- **Enhancement:** Users assigned IT [licenses](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) can now edit and manage [global connections settings](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections#connection-management).
- **New**: Paginated [GraphQL](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql) endpoints for metadata queries in Semantic Layer are now available. This improves integration load times for large manifests. For more information, see [Metadata calls](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql#metadata-calls).

## June 2025

- **New**: [System for Cross-Domain Identity Management](/docs/cloud/manage-access/scim#scim-configuration-for-entra-id) (SCIM) through Microsoft Entra ID is now GA. Also available on legacy Enterprise plans. 
- **Enhancement:** You can now set the [compilation environment](/docs/explore/access-dbt-insights#set-jinja-environment) to control how Jinja functions are rendered in dbt Insights.
- **Beta**: The dbt Fusion engine supports the BigQuery adapter in beta.
- **New:** You can now view the history of settings changes for [projects](/docs/cloud/account-settings), [environments](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments), and [jobs](/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs).
- **New:** Added support for the latest version of BigQuery credentials in Semantic Layer and MetricFlow.
- **New:**  Snowflake External OAuth is now supported for Semantic Layer queries.
Snowflake connections that use External OAuth for user credentials can now emit queries for <Constant name="query_page" />, <Constant name="cloud_cli" />, and <Constant name="cloud_ide" /> through the Semantic Layer Gateway. This enables secure, identity-aware access via providers like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
- **New:** You can now [download your managed Git repo](/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository#download-managed-repository) from the dbt platform.
- **New**: The <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> now supports Trino as a data platform. For more details, see [Set up the <Constant name="semantic_layer" />](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl).
- **New**: The dbt Fusion engine supports Databricks in beta.
- **Enhancement**: Group owners can now specify multiple email addresses for model-level notifications, enabling broader team alerts. Previously, only a single email address was supported. Check out the [Configure groups](/docs/deploy/model-notifications#configure-groups) section to learn more.
- **New**: The Semantic Layer GraphQL API now has a [`List a saved query`](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql#list-a-saved-query) endpoint.

- **Enhancement**: The <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> now supports SSH tunneling for [Postgres](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-postgresql-alloydb) or [Redshift](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift) connections. Refer to [Set up the <Constant name="semantic_layer" />](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl) for more information.
- **Behavior change**: Users assigned the [`job admin` permission set](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#job-admin) now have access to set up integrations for projects, including the [Tableau](/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau) integration to populate downstream exposures.

## March 2025

- **Behavior change**: As of March 31st, 2025, <Constant name="core" /> versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 have been deprecated from <Constant name="cloud" />. They are no longer available to select as versions for dbt projects. Workloads currently on these versions will be automatically upgraded to v1.3, which may cause new failures.
- **Enhancement**: [<Constant name="semantic_layer" />](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) users on single-tenant configurations no longer need to contact their account representative to enable this feature. Setup is now self-service and available across all tenant configurations.
- **New**: The <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> now supports Postgres as a data platform. For more details on how to set up the <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> for Postgres, see [Set up the <Constant name="semantic_layer" />](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl).
- **New**: New [environment variable default](/docs/build/environment-variables#dbt-cloud-context) `DBT_CLOUD_INVOCATION_CONTEXT`.

#### dbt Developer day

The following features are new or enhanced as part of our [dbt Developer day](https://www.getdbt.com/resources/webinars/dbt-developer-day) on March 19th and 20th, 2025:

- **New**: The [`--sample` flag](/docs/build/sample-flag), now available for the `run` and `build` commands, helps reduce build times and warehouse costs by running dbt in sample mode. It generates filtered refs and sources using time-based sampling, allowing developers to validate outputs without building entire models.
- **New**: <Constant name="copilot" />, an AI-powered assistant, is now generally available in the Cloud IDE for all <Constant name="cloud" /> Enterprise accounts. Check out [<Constant name="copilot" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) for more information.   

#### Also available this month

- **New**: Bringing your own [Azure OpenAI key](/docs/cloud/enable-dbt-copilot#bringing-your-own-openai-api-key-byok) for [<Constant name="copilot" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) is now generally available. Your organization can configure <Constant name="copilot" /> to use your own Azure OpenAI keys, giving you more control over data governance and billing.
- **New**: The <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> supports Power BI as a [partner integration](/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations), available in private beta. To join the private beta, please reach out to your account representative. Check out the [Power BI](/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/power-bi) integration for more information.
- **New**: [<Constant name="cloud" /> release tracks](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) are Generally Available. Depending on their plan, customers may select among the Latest, Compatible, or Extended tracks to manage the update cadences for development and deployment environments.
- **New:** The <Constant name="cloud" />-native integration with Azure DevOps now supports [Entra ID service principals](/docs/cloud/git/setup-service-principal). Unlike a services user, which represents a real user object in Entra ID, the service principal is a secure identity associated with your <Constant name="cloud" /> app to access resources in Azure unattended. Please [migrate your service user](/docs/cloud/git/setup-service-principal#migrate-to-service-principal) to a service principal for Azure DevOps  as soon as possible.


## February 2025

- **Enhancement**: The [Python SDK](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-python) added a new timeout parameter to Semantic Layer client and to underlying GraphQL clients to specify timeouts. Set a timeout number or use the `total_timeout` parameter in the global `TimeoutOptions` to control connect, execute and close timeouts granularly. `ExponentialBackoff.timeout_ms` is now deprecated.
- **New**: The [Azure DevOps](/docs/cloud/git/connect-azure-devops) integration for <Constant name="git" /> now supports [Entra service principal apps](/docs/cloud/git/setup-service-principal) on <Constant name="cloud" /> Enterprise accounts. Microsoft is enforcing MFA across user accounts, including service users, which will impact existing app integrations. This is a phased rollout, and dbt Labs recommends [migrating to a service principal](/docs/cloud/git/setup-service-principal#migrate-to-service-principal) on existing integrations once the option becomes available in your account.
- **New**: Added the `dbt invocation` command to the [dbt CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation). This command allows you to view and manage active invocations, which are long-running sessions in the dbt CLI. For more information, see [dbt invocation](/reference/commands/invocation).
- **New**: Users can now switch themes directly from the user menu, available [in Preview](/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles#dbt-cloud). We have added support for **Light mode** (default), **Dark mode**, and automatic theme switching based on system preferences. The selected theme is stored in the user profile and will follow users across all devices.
  - Dark mode is currently available on the Developer plan and will be available for all [plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) in the future. We’ll be rolling it out gradually, so stay tuned for updates. For more information, refer to [Change your <Constant name="cloud" /> theme](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/change-your-dbt-cloud-theme).
- **Fix**: <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> errors in the Cloud IDE are now displayed with proper formatting, fixing an issue where newlines appeared broken or difficult to read. This fix ensures error messages are more user-friendly and easier to parse.
- **Fix**: Fixed an issue where [saved queries](/docs/build/saved-queries) with no [exports](/docs/build/saved-queries#configure-exports) would fail with an `UnboundLocalError`. Previously, attempting to process a saved query without any exports would cause an error due to an undefined relation variable. Exports are optional, and this fix ensures saved queries without exports don't fail.
- **New**: You can now query metric alias in <Constant name="semantic_layer" /> [GraphQL](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql) and [JDBC](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc) APIs. 
  - For the JDBC API, refer to [Query metric alias](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc#query-metric-alias) for more information.
  - For the GraphQL API, refer to [Query metric alias](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-graphql#query-metric-alias) for more information.
- **Enhancement**: Added support to automatically refresh access tokens when Snowflake's SSO connection expires. Previously, users would get the following error: `Connection is not available, request timed out after 30000ms` and would have to wait 10 minutes to try again.
- **Enhancement**: The [`dbt_version` format](/reference/commands/version#versioning) in dbt Cloud now better aligns with [semantic versioning rules](https://semver.org/). Leading zeroes have been removed from the month and day (`YYYY.M.D+<suffix>`). For example:
  - New format: `2024.10.8+996c6a8`
  - Previous format: `2024.10.08+996c6a8`
