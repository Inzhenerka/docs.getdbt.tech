## Resources 

- <Constant name="core" /> v1.10 changelog (coming soon)
- [<Constant name="core" /> CLI Installation guide](/docs/core/installation-overview)
- [Cloud upgrade guide](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#release-tracks)

## What to know before upgrading

<Constant name="dbt" /> Labs is committed to providing backward compatibility for all versions 1.x. Any behavior changes will be accompanied by a [behavior change flag](/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#behavior-change-flags) to provide a migration window for existing projects. If you encounter an error upon upgrading, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/new).

Starting in 2024, <Constant name="cloud" /> provides the functionality from new versions of <Constant name="core" /> via [release tracks](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) with automatic upgrades. If you have selected the "Latest" release track in <Constant name="cloud" />, you already have access to all the features, fixes, and other functionality that is included in <Constant name="core" /> v1.10! If you have selected the "Compatible" release track, you will have access in the next monthly "Compatible" release after the <Constant name="core" /> v1.10 final release.

For users of dbt Core, since v1.8, we recommend explicitly installing both `dbt-core` and `dbt-<youradapter>`. This may become required for a future version of dbt. For example:

```sql
python3 -m pip install <Constant name="core" /> <Constant name="dbt" />-snowflake
```

## New and changed features and functionality

New features and functionality available in <Constant name="core" /> v1.10

### The `--sample` flag

Large data sets can slow down dbt build times, making it harder for developers to test new code efficiently. The [`--sample` flag](/docs/build/sample-flag), available for the `run` and `build` commands, helps reduce build times and warehouse costs by running dbt in sample mode. It generates filtered refs and sources using time-based sampling, allowing developers to validate outputs without building entire models.

### Integrating dbt Core artifacts with dbt Cloud projects

With [hybrid projects](/docs/deploy/hybrid-projects), <Constant name="core"/> users working in the command line interface (CLI) can execute runs that seamlessly upload [artifacts](/reference/artifacts/dbt-artifacts) into <Constant name="cloud"/>. This enhances hybrid <Constant name="core"/>/<Constant name="cloud"/> deployments by:

- Fostering collaboration between dbt <Constant name="cloud"/> and <Constant name="core"/> users by enabling them to visualize and perform [cross-project references](/docs/collaborate/govern/project-dependencies#how-to-write-cross-project-ref) to models defined in <Constant name="core"/> projects. This feature unifies <Constant name="cloud"/> and <Constant name="core"/> workflows for a more connected <Constant name="dbt"/> experience.
- Giving <Constant name="cloud"/> and <Constant name="core"/> users insights into their models and assets in [<Constant name="explorer"/>](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects). To view <Constant name="explorer"/>, you must have have a [developer or read-only license](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users).
- (Coming soon) Enabling users working in the [<Constant name="visual_editor"/>](/docs/cloud/visual-editor) to build off of models already created by a central data team in <Constant name="core"/> rather than having to start from scratch.

Hybrid projects are available as a private beta to [dbt <Constant name="cloud"/> Enterprise accounts](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing). Contact your account representative to register your interest in the beta.

### Managing changes to legacy behaviors

dbt Core v1.10 introduces new flags for [managing changes to legacy behaviors](/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes). You may opt into recently introduced changes (disabled by default), or opt out of mature changes (enabled by default), by setting `True` / `False` values, respectively, for `flags` in `dbt_project.yml`.

You can read more about each of these behavior changes in the following links:

- (Introduced, disabled by default) [`validate_macro_args`](/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#macro-argument-validation). If the flag is set to `True`, dbt will raise a warning if the argument `type` names you've added in your macro YAMLs don't match the argument names in your macro or if the argument types aren't valid according to the [supported types](/reference/resource-properties/arguments#supported-types).

## Quick hits

- Provide the [`loaded_at_query`](/reference/resource-properties/freshness#loaded_at_query) property for source freshness to specify custom SQL to generate the `maxLoadedAt` time stamp on the source (versus the [built-in query](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/blob/6c41bedf27063eda64375845db6ce5f7535ef6aa/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/freshness.sql#L4-L16), which uses the `loaded_at_field`). You cannot define `loaded_at_query` if the `loaded_at_field` config is also provided.

- Provide validation for macro arguments using the [`validate_macro_args`](/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#macro-argument-validation) flag, which is disabled by default. When enabled, this flag checks that documented macro argument names match those in the macro definition and validates their types against a supported format. Previously, dbt did not enforce standard argument types, treating the type field as documentation-only. If no arguments are documented, dbt infers them from the macro and includes them in the manifest.json file. Learn more about [supported types](/reference/resource-properties/arguments#supported-types).
