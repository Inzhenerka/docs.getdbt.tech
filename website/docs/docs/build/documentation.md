Good documentation for your dbt models will help downstream consumers discover and understand the datasets you curate for them.
dbt provides a way to generate documentation for your dbt project and render it as a website.

## Overview

dbt provides a scalable way to [generate](#generating-documentation) documentation for your dbt project using descriptions and commands. The documentation for your project includes:
* **Information about your project**: including model code, a DAG of your project, any tests you've added to a column, and more.
* **Information about your <Term id="data-warehouse" />**: including column data types, and <Term id="table" /> sizes. This information is generated by running queries against the information schema.
* Importantly, dbt also provides a way to add **descriptions** to models, columns, sources, and more, to further enhance your documentation.

The following sections describe how to [add descriptions](#adding-descriptions-to-your-project) to your project, [generate documentation](#generating-documentation), how to use [docs blocks](#using-docs-blocks), and set a [custom overview](#setting-a-custom-overview) for your documentation.

## Adding descriptions to your project

Before generating documentation, add [descriptions](/reference/resource-properties/description) to your project resources. Add the `description:` key to the same YAML files where you declare [tests](/docs/build/data-tests). For example:

<File name='models/<filename>.yml'>

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: events
    description: This table contains clickstream events from the marketing website

    columns:
      - name: event_id
        description: This is a unique identifier for the event
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: user-id
        quote: true
        description: The user who performed the event
        tests:
          - not_null

```
</File>

## Generating documentation

Generate documentation for your project by following these steps:

1. Run the `dbt docs generate` [command](/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-generate) to compile relevant information about your dbt project and warehouse into `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files, respectively. 
2. Ensure you've created the models with `dbt run` or `dbt build` to view the documentation for all columns, not just those described in your project.
3. Run the `dbt docs serve` [command](/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-serve) if you're developing locally to use these `.json` files to populate a local website.

dbt provides two complementary ways to [view documentation](/docs/build/view-documentation), and your descriptions, after it's generated:

- [**dbt Docs**:](/docs/build/view-documentation#dbt-docs) A static documentation site with model lineage, metadata, and documentation that can be hosted on your web server (like S3 or Netlify). Available for <Constant name="core" /> or <Constant name="cloud" /> Developer plans.
- [**<Constant name="explorer" />**](/docs/explore/explore-projects): Builds upon dbt Docs to provide a dynamic, real-time interface with enhanced metadata, customizable views, deeper project insights, and collaboration tools. Available on <Constant name="cloud" /> [Starter, Enterprise, or Enterprise+ plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing).

See [View documentation](/docs/build/view-documentation) to get the most out of your dbt project's documentation.

## Using docs blocks

Docs blocks provide a robust method for documenting models and other resources using Jinja and markdown. Docs block files can contain arbitrary markdown, but they must be uniquely named. 

### Syntax
To declare a docs block, use the Jinja `docs` tag. Their names may contain:

- Can't start with a digit
- Uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Underscores (_)

<File name='events.md'>

```markdown
{% docs table_events %}

This table contains clickstream events from the marketing website.

The events in this table are recorded by [Snowplow](http://github.com/snowplow/snowplow) and piped into the warehouse on an hourly basis. The following pages of the marketing site are tracked:
 - /
 - /about
 - /team
 - /contact-us

{% enddocs %}
```

</File>

In this example, a docs block named `table_events` is defined with some descriptive markdown contents. There is nothing significant about the name `table_events` — docs blocks can be named however you like, as long as the name only contains alphanumeric and underscore characters and doesn't start with a numeric character.

### Placement

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.9">

Docs blocks should be placed in files with a `.md` file extension. By default, dbt will search in all resource paths for docs blocks (for example, the combined list of [model-paths](/reference/project-configs/model-paths), [seed-paths](/reference/project-configs/seed-paths), [analysis-paths](/reference/project-configs/analysis-paths), [test-paths](/reference/project-configs/test-paths), [macro-paths](/reference/project-configs/macro-paths), and [snapshot-paths](/reference/project-configs/snapshot-paths)) &mdash; you can adjust this behavior using the [docs-paths](/reference/project-configs/docs-paths) config.

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.8">

Docs blocks should be placed in files with a `.md` file extension. By default, dbt will search in all resource paths for docs blocks (for example, the combined list of [model-paths](/reference/project-configs/model-paths), [seed-paths](/reference/project-configs/seed-paths), [analysis-paths](/reference/project-configs/analysis-paths), [macro-paths](/reference/project-configs/macro-paths), and [snapshot-paths](/reference/project-configs/snapshot-paths)) &mdash; you can adjust this behavior using the [docs-paths](/reference/project-configs/docs-paths) config.

</VersionBlock>

### Usage
To use a docs block, reference it from your `schema.yml` file with the [doc()](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/doc) function in place of a markdown string. Using the examples above, the `table_events` docs can be included in the `schema.yml` file as shown here:

<File name='schema.yml'>

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: events
    description: '{{ doc("table_events") }}'

    columns:
      - name: event_id
        description: This is a unique identifier for the event
        tests:
            - unique
            - not_null
```

</File>

In the resulting documentation, `'{{ doc("table_events") }}'` will be expanded to the markdown defined in the `table_events` docs block.


## Setting a custom overview
*Currently available for dbt Docs only.*

The "overview" shown in the dbt Docs website can be overridden by supplying your own docs block called `__overview__`. 

- By default, dbt supplies an overview with helpful information about the docs site itself.
- Depending on your needs, it may be a good idea to override this docs block with specific information about your company style guide, links to reports, or information about who to contact for help. 
- To override the default overview, create a docs block that looks like this:

<File name='models/overview.md'>

```markdown
{% docs __overview__ %}
# Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) playbook.
This dbt project is a worked example to demonstrate how to model subscription
revenue. **Check out the full write-up \[here](https://blog.getdbt.com/modeling-subscription-revenue/),
as well as the repo for this project \[here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/mrr-playbook/).**
...

{% enddocs %}
```

</File>

### Custom project-level overviews
*Currently available for dbt Docs only.*

You can set different overviews for each dbt project/package included in your documentation site
by creating a docs block named `__[project_name]__`. 

For example, in order to define
custom overview pages that appear when a viewer navigates inside the `dbt_utils` or `snowplow` package:

<File name='models/overview.md'>

```markdown
{% docs __dbt_utils__ %}
# Utility macros
Our dbt project heavily uses this suite of utility macros, especially:
- `surrogate_key`
- `test_equality`
- `pivot`
{% enddocs %}

{% docs __snowplow__ %}
# Snowplow sessionization
Our organization uses this package of transformations to roll Snowplow events
up to page views and sessions.
{% enddocs %}
```
