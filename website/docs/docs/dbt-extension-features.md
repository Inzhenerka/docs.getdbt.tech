The dbt VS Code extension is backed by a the speed and power of the dbt Fusion engine and a dynamic Language Server Protocol (LSP) that enables enhanced workflows, faster development, and easy navigation.

The following extension features help you get more done, fast:

- **[Live error detection](#live-error-detection):** Automatically validate your SQL code to detect errors and surface warnings, without hitting the warehouse. This includes both dbt errors (like invalid `ref`) and SQL errors (like invalid column name or SQL syntax).
- **[Lightning-fast parse times](#lightning-fast-parse-times):** Parse even the largest projects up to 30x faster than dbt Core.
- **[Powerful IntelliSense](#powerful-intellisense):** Autocomplete SQL functions, model names, columns, macros, and more.
- **[Instant refactoring](#instant-refactoring):** Rename models or columns and see references update project-wide.
- **[Go-to-definition](#go-to-definition-and-reference):** Jump to the definition of any `ref`, macro, model, or column with a single click. Particularly useful in large projects with many models and macros.
- **[Hover insights](#hover-insights):** See context on tables, columns, and functions without leaving your code. Simply hover over any SQL element to see details like column names and data types.
- **[Live CTE previews](#live-preview-for-models-and-ctes):** Preview a CTE’s output directly from inside your dbt model for faster validation and debugging.
- **[Rich lineage in context](#rich-lineage-in-context):** See lineage at the column or table level as you develop with no context switching or breaking the flow.
- **[View compiled code](#view-compiled-code):** Get a live view of the SQL code your models will build alongside your dbt code.
- **[Build flexibly](#build-flexibly):** Use the command palette to build models with complex selectors.
 
### Live error detection

Automatically validate your SQL code to detect errors and surface warnings without hitting the warehouse.

- Displays diagnostics (red squiggles) for:
  - Syntax errors (missing commas, misspelled keywords, etc).
  - Invalid / missing column names (for example, `select not_a_column from {{ ref('real_model') }}`).
  - Missing `group by` clauses, or columns that are neither grouped nor aggregated.
  - Invalid function names or arguments
- Hover over red squiggles to display errors.
- Full diagnostic information is available in the “Problems”.

### Lightning-fast parse times

Parse even the largest projects up to 30x faster than with dbt Core.

### Powerful IntelliSense

Autocomplete SQL functions, model names, columns, macros and more.

Usage:
- Autocomplete `ref`s and `source` calls. For example, type `{{ ref(`  or `{{ source(` and you will see a list of available resources and their type complete the function call.
- Autocomplete dialect-specific function names.

### Instant refactoring

Renaming models:
 - Right-click on a file in the file tree and select **Rename**.
 - After renaming the file, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to make refactoring changes.
  - Select **OK** to apply the changes, or **Show Preview** to display a preview of refactorings.
 - After applying your changes, `ref`s should be updated to use the updated model name.

Renaming columns:
- Right-click on a column alias and select **Rename Symbol**.
- After renaming the column, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to make refactoring changes.
  - Select **OK** to apply the changes, or **Show Preview** to show a preview of refactorings.
- After applying your changes, downstream references to the column should be updated to use the new column name.

Note: Renaming models and columns is not yet supported for snapshots, or any resources defined in a .yml file.

### Go-to-definition and reference

Jump to the definition of any `ref`, macro, model, or column with a single click. Particularly useful in large projects with many models and macros.

Usage:
- Command or Ctrl-click to go to the definition for an identifier.
- You can also right-click an identifier or and select **Go to Definition** or **Go to References**.
- Supports CTE names, column names, `*`, macro names, and dbt `ref()` and `source()` call.

### Hover insights

See context on tables, columns, and functions without leaving your code. Simply hover over any SQL element to see details like column names and data types.

Usage:
- Hover over `*` to see expanded list of columns and their types.
- Hover over column name or alias to see its type.

### Live preview for models and CTEs

Preview a CTE’s output, or an entire model, directly from inside your editor for faster validation and debugging.

Usage:
- Click the **table icon** or use keyboard shortcut `cmd+enter` (macOS) / `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux) to preview query results.
- Click the **Preview CTE** codelens to preview CTE results.
- Results will be displayed in the **Query Results** tab in the bottom panel.
- The preview table is sortable and results are stored until the tab is closed.
- You can also select a range of SQL to preview the results of a specific SQL snippet.

### Rich lineage in context

See lineage at the column or table level as you develop — no context switching or breaking flow.

View table lineage:
- Open the **Lineage** tab in your editor. It will reflect table lineage focused on the currently-open file.
- Double-click nodes to open the files in your editor.
- The lineage pane updates as you navigate the files in your dbt project.
- Right-click on a node to update the DAG, or view column lineage for a node.

View column lineage:
- Right-click on a filename, or in the SQL contents of a model file.
- Select **dbt: View Lineage** --> **Show column lineage**.
- Select the column to view lineage for.
- Double-click on a node to update the DAG selector.
- You can also use column selectors in the lineage window by adding the `column:` prefix and appending the column name. 
  - For example, if you want the lineage for the `AMOUNT` column of your `stg_payments` model, edit the `+model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments+` to `+column:model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments.AMOUNT+`.

### View compiled code

Get a live view of the SQL code your models will build — right alongside your dbt code.

Usage:
- Click the **code icon** to view compiled code side-by-side with source code.
- Compiled code will update as you save your source code.
- Clicking on a dbt macro will focus the corresponding compiled code.
- Clicking on a compiled code block will focus the corresponding source code.

### Build flexibly

Use the command palette to quickly build models using complex selectors. 

Usage:
- Click the **dbt icon** or use keyboard shortcut `cmd+shift+enter` (macOS) / `ctrl+shift+enter` (Windows/Linux) to launch a quickpick menu.
- Select a command to run.
