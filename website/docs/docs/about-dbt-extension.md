# About the dbt VS Code Extension <Lifecycle status="preview" />

The dbt VS Code extension brings a hyper-fast, intelligent, and cost-efficient dbt development experience to VS Code.
This is the only way to enjoy all the power of the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> while developing locally. 

- _Save time and resources_ with near-instant parsing, live error detection, powerful IntelliSense capabilities, and more.
- _Stay in flow_ with a seamless, end-to-end dbt development experience designed from scratch for local dbt development.

The dbt VS Code extension is available in the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbtLabsInc.dbt). _Note, this is a public preview release. Behavior may change ahead of the broader generally available (GA) release._

## Productivity features

The following extension features help you get more done, fast:

- **[Live error detection](#live-error-detection):** Automatically validate your SQL code to detect errors and surface warnings, without hitting the warehouse. This includes both dbt errors (like invalid `ref`) and SQL errors (like invalid column name or SQL syntax).
- **[Lightning-fast parse times](#lightning-fast-parse-times):** Parse even the largest projects up to 30x faster than dbt Core.
- **[Powerful IntelliSense](#powerful-intellisense):** Autocomplete SQL functions, model names, columns, macros, and more.
- **[Instant refactoring](#instant-refactoring):** Rename models or columns and see references update project-wide.
- **[Go-to-definition](#go-to-definition-and-reference):** Jump to the definition of any `ref`, macro, model, or column with a single click. Particularly useful in large projects with many models and macros.
- **[Hover insights](#hover-insights):** See context on tables, columns, and functions without leaving your code. Simply hover over any SQL element to see details like column names and data types.
- **[Live CTE previews](#live-preview-for-models-and-ctes):** Preview a CTE’s output directly from inside your dbt model for faster validation and debugging.
- **[Rich lineage in context](#rich-lineage-in-context):** See lineage at the column or table level as you develop with no context switching or breaking the flow.
- **[View compiled code](#view-compiled-code):** Get a live view of the SQL code your models will build alongside your dbt code.
- **[Build flexibly](#build-flexibly):** Use the command palette to build models with complex selectors.
 
### Live error detection

Automatically validate your SQL code to detect errors and surface warnings without hitting the warehouse.

- Displays diagnostics (red squiggles) for:
  - Syntax errors (missing commas, misspelled keywords, etc).
  - Invalid / missing column names (for example, `select not_a_column from {{ ref('real_model') }}`).
  - Missing `group by` clauses, or columns that are neither grouped nor aggregated.
  - Invalid function names or arguments
- Hover over red squiggles to display errors.
- Full diagnostic information is available in the “Problems”.

### Instant refactoring

Renaming models:
 - Right-click on a file in the file tree and select **Rename**.
 - After renaming the file, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to make refactoring changes.
  - Select **OK** to apply the changes, or **Show Preview** to display a preview of refactorings.
 - After applying your changes, `ref`s should be updated to use the updated model name.

Renaming columns:
- Right-click on a column alias and select **Rename Symbol**.
- After renaming the column, you'll get a prompt asking if you want to make refactoring changes.
  - Select **OK** to apply the changes, or **Show Preview** to show a preview of refactorings.
- After applying your changes, downstream references to the column should be updated to use the new column name.

Note: Renaming models and columns is not yet supported for snapshots, or any resources defined in a .yml file.

### Live preview for models and CTEs

Preview a CTE’s output, or an entire model, directly from inside your editor for faster validation and debugging.

Usage:
- Click the **table icon** or use keyboard shortcut `cmd+enter` (macOS) / `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux) to preview query results.
- Click the **Preview CTE** codelens to preview CTE results.
- Results will be displayed in the **Query Results** tab in the bottom panel.
- The preview table is sortable and results are stored until the tab is closed.
- You can also select a range of SQL to preview the results of a specific SQL snippet.

### Rich lineage in context

See lineage at the column or table level as you develop — no context switching or breaking flow.

View table lineage:
- Open the **Lineage** tab in your editor. It will reflect table lineage focused on the currently-open file.
- Double-click nodes to open the files in your editor.
- The lineage pane updates as you navigate the files in your dbt project.
- Right-click on a node to update the DAG, or view column lineage for a node.

View column lineage:
- Right-click on a filename, or in the SQL contents of a model file.
- Select **dbt: View Lineage** --> **Show column lineage**.
- Select the column to view lineage for.
- Double-click on a node to update the DAG selector.
- You can also use column selectors in the lineage window by adding the `column:` prefix and appending the column name. 
  - For example, if you want the lineage for the `AMOUNT` column of your `stg_payments` model, edit the `+model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments+` to `+column:model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments.AMOUNT+`.

## Using the extension

Your dbt environment must be using the dbt Fusion engine in order to use this extension. See [the Fusion documentation](/docs/fusion/about-fusion) for more on eligibility and upgrading.

Once installed, the dbt extension automatically activates when you open any `.sql` or `.yml` file inside of a dbt project directory. 

## Configuration

After installation, you may want to configure the extension to better fit your development workflow:

1. Open the VS Code settings by pressing `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+,` (Mac).
2. Search for `dbt`. On this page, you can adjust the extension’s configuration options as to fit your needs.

## Known limitations

The following are currently known limitations of the dbt extension:

- **Remote development:** The dbt extension does not yet support remote development sessions over SSH. Support will be added in a future release. For more information on remote development, refer to [Supporting Remote Development and GitHub Codespaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions) and [Visual Studio Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server).

- **Working with YAML files:** Today, the dbt extension has the following limitations with operating on YAML files:
  - Go-to-definition is not supported for nodes defined in YAML files (like snapshots).
  - Renaming models and columns will not update references in YAML files.
  - Future releases of the dbt extension will address these limitations

- **Renaming models:** When a model file is renamed, the dbt extension will apply edits to update all `ref()` calls that reference the renamed model. Due to limitations of VS Code's Language Server Client, we are not able to auto-save these edit files. As a result, you may see that renaming a model file results in compiler errors in your project. To fix these errors, you must either manually save each file that was edited by the dbt extension, or click **File** --> **Save All** to save all edited files.
