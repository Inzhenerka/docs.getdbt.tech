## Connecting to ClickHouse

To connect to ClickHouse from dbt, you'll need to add a [profile](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/connection-profiles)
to your `profiles.yml` configuration file. Follow the reference configuration below to set up a ClickHouse profile:

<File name='profiles.yml'>
```yaml
clickhouse-service:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: clickhouse
      schema: [ default ] # ClickHouse database for dbt models

      # optional
      host: [ localhost ]
      port: [ 8123 ]  # Defaults to 8123, 8443, 9000, 9440 depending on the secure and driver settings 
      user: [ default ] # User for all database operations
      password: [ <empty string> ] # Password for the user
      secure: [ False ] # Use TLS (native protocol) or HTTPS (http protocol)

```

For a complete list of configuration options, see the [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/dbt).
</File>

### Create a dbt project
You can now use this profile in one of your existing projects or create a new one using:

```sh
dbt init project_name
```

Navigate to the `project_name` directory and update your `dbt_project.yml` file to use the profile you configured to connect to ClickHouse.

```yaml
profile: 'clickhouse-service'
```

### Test connection

Execute `dbt debug` with the CLI tool to confirm whether dbt is able to connect to ClickHouse. Confirm the response includes `Connection test: [OK connection ok]`, indicating a successful connection.
