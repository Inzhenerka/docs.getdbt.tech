<Constant name="dbt" /> enables data teams to transform data using analytics engineering best practices. You can install dbt locally using these options:

* Local command line interface (CLI) tools leveraging the speed and scale of the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> or using our legacy Core product
* VS Code and Cursor with dbt extension

If you're interested in using the <Constant name="dbt_platform" />, our feature-rich, browser-based UI, you can learn more in [About dbt set up](/docs/cloud/about-cloud-setup).

 This section of our docs will guide you through various settings to get started:

- [Connecting to a data platform](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml)
- [How to run your dbt projects](/docs/running-a-dbt-project/run-your-dbt-projects)

If you're interested in using a command line interface to [develop dbt projects in <Constant name="cloud" />](/docs/cloud/about-develop-dbt), the [<Constant name="cloud" /> CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) lets you run dbt commands locally. The <Constant name="cloud" /> CLI is tailored for <Constant name="cloud" />'s infrastructure and integrates with all its [features](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/dbt-cloud-features).
