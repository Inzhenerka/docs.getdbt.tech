<Constant name="dbt" /> enables data teams to transform data using analytics engineering best practices. Choose your local development experience from these tools:

* Local command line interface (CLI) tools leveraging the speed and scale of the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> or using our legacy Core product
* VS Code or Cursor with the dbt extension

If you're interested in using the <Constant name="dbt_platform" />, our feature-rich, browser-based UI, you can learn more in [About dbt set up](/docs/cloud/about-cloud-setup).
 
After choosing and installing your local development experience, you can get started:

- Explore a detailed first-time setup guide for [dbt Fusion engine](/guides/fusion?step=1).
- [Connect to a data platform](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/about-core-connections).
- Learn [how to run your dbt projects](/docs/running-a-dbt-project/run-your-dbt-projects).
