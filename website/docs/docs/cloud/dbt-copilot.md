# About dbt Copilot <Lifecycle status="self_service,managed,managed_plus" /> 

<IntroText>
<Constant name="copilot" /> is a powerful, AI-powered assistant fully integrated into your <Constant name="cloud" /> experience—designed to accelerate your analytics workflows.

</IntroText>

<Constant name="copilot" /> embeds AI-driven assistance across every stage of the [analytics development life cycle (ADLC)](https://www.getdbt.com/resources/guides/the-analytics-development-lifecycle) and harnesses rich metadata—capturing relationships, lineage, and context  &mdash; so you can deliver refined, trusted data products at speed.

With automatic code generation and using natural language prompts, <Constant name="copilot" /> can [generate code](/docs/cloud/use-dbt-copilot), [documentation](/docs/build/documentation), [tests](/docs/build/data-tests), [metrics](/docs/build/metrics-overview), and [semantic models](/docs/build/semantic-models) for you with the click of a button in the [<Constant name="cloud_ide" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-copilot), [<Constant name="visual_editor" />](/docs/cloud/build-canvas-copilot), and [<Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/dbt-insights).

:::tip
<Constant name="copilot" /> is available on Starter, Enterprise, and Enterprise+ accounts. [Book a demo](https://www.getdbt.com/contact) to see how AI-driven development can streamline your workflow.

## How dbt Copilot works

<Constant name="copilot" /> enhances efficiency by automating repetitive tasks while ensuring data privacy and security. It works as follows:

- Access <Constant name="copilot" /> through:
  - The [<Constant name="cloud_ide" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-copilot) to generate documentation, tests, semantic models.
  - The [<Constant name="visual_editor" /> ](/docs/cloud/build-canvas-copilot) (beta) to generate SQL code using natural language prompts. <Lifecycle status="managed,managed_plus" /> 
  - The [<Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/dbt-insights) to generate SQL queries for analysis using natural language prompts. <Lifecycle status="managed,managed_plus" /> 
- <Constant name="copilot" /> gathers metadata (like column names, model SQL, documentation) but never accesses row-level warehouse data.
- The metadata and user prompts are sent to the AI provider (in this case, OpenAI) through API calls for processing.
- The AI-generated content is returned to <Constant name="cloud" /> for you to review, edit, and save within your project files.
- <Constant name="copilot" /> does not use warehouse data to train AI models.
- No sensitive data persists on dbt Labs' systems, except for usage data.
- Client data, including any personal or sensitive data inserted into the query by the user, is deleted within 30 days by OpenAI.
- <Constant name="copilot" /> uses a best practice style guide to ensure consistency across teams.
- <Constant name="copilot" /> is optimized for OpenAI's `gpt-3.x`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1-[mini|nano]`, and `gpt-4.5` (deprecated by OpenAI) models. Other models, like `o1` and `o2`, are not supported and will not work with <Constant name="copilot"/>.

:::tip
<Constant name="copilot" /> accelerates, but doesn’t replace, your analytics engineer. It helps deliver better data products faster, but always review AI-generated content, as it may be incorrect.
