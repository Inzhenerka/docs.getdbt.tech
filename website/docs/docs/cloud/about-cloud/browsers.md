### Browser sessions

A session is a period of time during which you’re signed in to a <Constant name="cloud" /> account from a browser. If you close your browser, it will end your session and log you out. You'll need to log in again the next time you try to access <Constant name="cloud" />. 

If you've logged in using [SSO](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview), you can customize your maximum session duration, which might vary depending on your identity provider (IdP).
