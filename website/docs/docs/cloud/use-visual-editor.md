<p style={{ color: '#717d7d', fontSize: '1.1em' }}>
Access and use the dbt Cloud visual editor to create or edit dbt models through a visual, drag-and-drop experience. Use the built-in AI for custom code generation in your development experience.

:::tip Beta feature
The visual editor provides users with a seamless and drag-and-drop experience inside of dbt Cloud. It's available in private beta for [dbt Cloud Enterprise accounts](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing). 

To join the private beta, [register your interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPjRGyrtgfmdY919Pf3kgqI5E95xxPXz-8JoVruw-L9jVtxg/viewform) or reach out to your account team to begin this process.

## Access visual editor

Before accessing the editor, you should have a dbt Cloud project already set up. This includes a Git repository, data platform connection, environments, and developer credentials. If you don't have this set up, please contact your dbt Cloud Admin.

To access the visual editor:

- Navigate to the left hand side panel.
- Click **Develop** and then select **Visual Editor**.

## Create a model
To create a dbt SQL model, click on **Create a new model** and perform the following steps. Note that you can't create source models in the visual editor. This is because you need to have production run with sources already created.

1. Drag an operator from the operator toolbar and drop it onto the canvas.
2. Click on the operator to open its configuration panel:	
	#### Input
	- **Input model**: Select the model and columns you want to use. 
	<br />
	#### Transform
	- **Join**: Define the join conditions and choose columns from both tables.
	- **Select**: Pick the columns you need from the model.
	- **Aggregate**: Specify the aggregation functions and the columns they apply to.
	- **Formula**: Add the formula to create a new column. Use the built-AI code generator to help generate SQL code by clicking on the question mark (?) icon. Enter your prompt and wait to see the results.
	- **Filter**: Set the conditions to filter data.
	- **Order**: Select the columns to sort by and the sort order.
	- **Limit**: Set the maximum number of rows you want to return.  
	<br />
	#### Output model
	- **Output model**: The final transformed dataset generated by a dbt model.

	Currently, you can only have one output model in the visual editor, but in the future, it'll be possible to have multiple output models.
3. View the **Output** and **SQL Code** tabs. 
	- Each operator has an Output tab that allows you to preview the data from that configured node.
	- The Code tab displays the SQL code generated by the node's configuration. Use this to see the SQL for your visual model config.
4. Connect the operators by using the connector by dragging your cursor between the operator's "+" start point and linking it to the other operators you want to connect to. This should create a connector line. 
	- Doing this allows the data to flow from the source table through various transformations you configured, to the final output.
5. Keep building your dbt model and ensure you confirm the out through the **Output** tab.

## Edit an existing model
To edit an existing model, navigate to the Visual Editor, click on the **Get Started** button on the upper right, and click **Edit existing model**. This will allow you to select the model you'd like to edit.

## Version control

Testing and documenting your models is an important part of the development process.  

Stay tuned! Coming very soon, you'll be able to version control your dbt modes in the visual editor. This ensures you can track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
