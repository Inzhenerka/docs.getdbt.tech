# Enable dbt Copilot <Lifecycle status="self_service,managed,managed_plus" /> 

<IntroText>
Enable <Constant name="copilot" />, an AI-powered assistant, in <Constant name="cloud" /> to speed up your development and focus on delivering quality data.
</IntroText>

This page explains how to enable <Constant name="copilot" /> in <Constant name="cloud" /> to speed up your development and allow you to focus on delivering quality data.

## Prerequisites

- Available in the <Constant name="cloud" /> only.
- Must have a [<Constant name="cloud" /> Starter, Enterprise, or Enterprise+ account](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing).
  - Certain features like [BYOK](#bringing-your-own-openai-api-key-byok), [natural prompts in Canvas](/docs/cloud/build-canvas-copilot), and more are only available on Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans.
- Development environment is on a supported [release track](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) to receive ongoing updates.
- By default, <Constant name="copilot" /> deployments use a central OpenAI API key managed by dbt Labs. Alternatively, you can [provide your own OpenAI API key](#bringing-your-own-openai-api-key-byok).
- <Constant name="copilot" /> is optimized for OpenAI's `gpt-3.x`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1-[mini|nano]`, and `gpt-4.5` (deprecated by OpenAI) models. Other models, like `o1` and `o2`, are not supported and will not work with <Constant name="copilot"/>.
- Opt-in to AI features by following the steps in the next section in your **Account settings**.

## Enable dbt Copilot

To opt in to <Constant name="copilot" />, a <Constant name="cloud" /> admin can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Account settings** in the navigation menu.
2. Under **Settings**, confirm the account you're enabling.
3. Click **Edit** in the top right corner.
4. Enable the **Enable account access to Copilot features** option.
5. Click **Save**. You should now have <Constant name="copilot" /> AI enabled for use.

Note: To disable (only after enabled), repeat steps 1 to 3, toggle off in step 4, and repeat step 5.

## Bringing your own OpenAI API key (BYOK) <Lifecycle status="managed_plus,managed" /> 

Once AI features have been enabled, you can provide your organization's OpenAI API key. <Constant name="cloud" /> will then leverage your OpenAI account and terms to power <Constant name="copilot" />. This will incur billing charges to your organization from OpenAI for requests made by <Constant name="copilot" />.

Configure AI keys using:
- dbt Labs-managed OpenAI API key
- Your own OpenAI API key
- Azure OpenAI

## AI integrations

Once AI features have been [enabled](/docs/cloud/enable-dbt-copilot#enable-dbt-copilot), you can use dbt Labs' AI integration or bring-your-own provider to support AI-powered <Constant name="cloud" /> features like [<Constant name="copilot" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) and [Ask dbt](/docs/cloud-integrations/snowflake-native-app).

<Constant name="cloud" /> supports AI integrations for dbt Labs-managed OpenAI keys, Self-managed OpenAI keys, or Self-managed Azure OpenAI keys.

Note, if you bring-your-own provider, you will incur API calls and associated charges for features used in <Constant name="cloud" />. Bringing your own provider is available for Enterprise or Enterprise+ plans.

:::info
<Constant name="cloud" />'s AI is optimized for OpenAIs gpt-4o. Using other models can affect performance and accuracy, and functionality with other models isn't guaranteed.

1. Navigate to **Account settings** in the side menu.
2. Select **Integrations** and scroll to the **AI** section.
3. Click on the **Pencil** icon to the right of **OpenAI** to configure the AI integration.
