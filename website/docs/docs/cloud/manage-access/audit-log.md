# dbt audit log <Lifecycle status="managed,managed_plus" />

To review actions performed by people in your organization, dbt provides logs of audited user and system events in real time. The audit log appears as events happen and includes details such as who performed the action, what the action was, and when it was performed. You can use these details to troubleshoot access issues, perform security audits, or analyze specific events. 

You must be an **Account Admin** or an **Account Viewer** to access the audit log and this feature is only available on Enterprise plans.

The <Constant name="cloud" /> audit log stores all the events that occurred in your organization in real-time, including:

- For events within 90 days, the <Constant name="cloud" /> audit log has a selectable date range that lists events triggered.
- For events beyond 90 days, **Account Admins** and **Account Viewers** can [export all events](#exporting-logs) by using **Export All**.

Note that the retention period for events in the audit log is at least 12 months. 

## Accessing the audit log

To access the audit log, click on your account name in the left side menu and select **Account settings**. Under **Settings**, click **Audit log**.

## Understanding the audit log

On the audit log page, you will see a list of various events and their associated event data. Each of these events show the following information in dbt:

* **Event name**: Action that was triggered
* **Agent**: User who triggered that action/event
* **Timestamp**: Local timestamp of when the event occurred

### Event details

Click the event card to see the details about the activity that triggered the event. This view provides important details, including when it happened and what type of event was triggered. For example, if someone changes the settings for a job, you can use the event details to see which job was changed (type of event: `job_definition.Changed`), by whom (person who triggered the event: `actor`), and when (time it was triggered: `created_at_utc`). For types of events and their descriptions, see [Events in audit log](#audit-log-events).

The event details provide the key factors of an event:

| Name                 | Description                                   |

| actor_id             | Unique ID of the actor                        |

| event_type           | Unique key identifying the event              |
| event_context        | This key will be different for each event and will match the event_type. This data will include all the details about the object(s) that was changed. |
| id                   | Unique ID of the event                        |

| source               | Source of the event - <Constant name="cloud" /> UI or API     |

## Searching the audit log

You can search the audit log to find a specific event or actor, which is limited to the ones listed in [Events in audit log](#events-in-audit-log). The audit log successfully lists historical events spanning the last 90 days. You can search for an actor or event using the search bar, and then narrow your results using the time window.

## Exporting logs

You can use the audit log to export all historical audit results for security, compliance, and analysis purposes. Events in the audit log are retained for at least 12 months.

- **For events within 90 days** &mdash; <Constant name="cloud" /> will automatically display the 90-day selectable date range. Select **Export Selection** to download a CSV file of all the events that occurred in your organization within 90 days.

- **For events beyond 90 days** &mdash; Select **Export All**. The Account Admin or Account Viewer will receive an email link to download a CSV file of all the events that occurred in your organization.
