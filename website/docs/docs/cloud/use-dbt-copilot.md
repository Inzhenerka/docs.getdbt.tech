# Use dbt Copilot <Lifecycle status="self_service,managed,managed_plus" /> 

<IntroText>
Use <Constant name="copilot" /> to generate documentation, tests, semantic models, and code from scratch, giving you the flexibility to modify or fix generated code.

</IntroText>

This page explains how to use <Constant name="copilot" /> to:

- [Generate resources](#generate-resources) &mdash; Save time by using <Constant name="copilot" />’s generation button to generate documentation, tests, and semantic model files during your development in the [<Constant name="cloud_ide" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud).
- [Generate and edit SQL inline](#generate-and-edit-sql-inline) &mdash; Use natural language prompts to generate SQL code from scratch or to edit existing SQL file by using keyboard shortcuts or highlighting code in the [<Constant name="cloud_ide" />](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud).
- [Build visual models](#build-visual-models) &mdash; Use <Constant name="copilot" /> to generate models in [<Constant name="visual_editor" />](/docs/cloud/use-canvas) with natural language prompts.
- [Build queries](#build-queries) &mdash; Use <Constant name="copilot" /> to generate queries in [<Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/dbt-insights) for exploratory data analysis using natural language prompts.
- [Analyze data with the Analyst agent](#analyze-data-with-the-analyst-agent) &mdash; Use <Constant name="copilot" /> to analyze your data and get contextualized results in real time by asking a natural language question to the Analyst agent.

## Build visual models

<Constant name="copilot" /> seamlessly integrates with the [<Constant name="visual_editor" />](/docs/cloud/canvas), a drag-and-drop experience that helps you build your visual models using natural language prompts. Before you begin, make sure you can [access the <Constant name="visual_editor" />](/docs/cloud/use-canvas#access-canvas).

## Build queries

Use <Constant name="copilot" /> to build queries in [<Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/dbt-insights) with natural language prompts to seamlessly explore and query data with an intuitive, context-rich interface. Before you begin, make sure you can [access <Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/access-dbt-insights).

To begin building SQL queries with natural language prompts in <Constant name="query_page" />:

1. Click the **<Constant name="copilot" />** icon in the Query console sidebar menu. 
2. Click **Generate SQL**.
3. In the dbt Copilot prompt box, enter your prompt in natural language for dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> to build the SQL query you want. <!--You can also reference existing models using the `@` symbol. For example, to build a model that calculates the total price of orders, you can enter `@orders` in the prompt and it'll pull in and reference the `orders` model.-->
4. Click **↑** to submit your prompt. <Constant name="copilot" /> generates a summary of the SQL query you want to build. To clear the prompt, click on the **Clear** button. To close the prompt box, click the <Constant name="copilot" /> icon again.
5. <Constant name="copilot" /> will automatically generate the SQL with an explanation of the query. 
   - Click **Add** to add the generated SQL to the existing query. 
   - Click **Replace** to replace the existing query with the generated SQL.
6. In the **Query console menu**, click the **Run** button to preview the data.
7. Confirm the results or continue building your model.

## Analyze data with the Analyst agent <Lifecycle status='private_beta' />

Use dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> to analyze your data and get contextualized results in real time by asking natural language questions to the [<Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/dbt-insights) Analyst agent. Before you begin, make sure you can [access <Constant name="query_page" />](/docs/explore/access-dbt-insights).

1. Click the **<Constant name="copilot" />** icon in the Query console sidebar menu.
2. Click **Agent**.
3. In the dbt <Constant name="copilot" /> prompt box, enter your question.
4. Click **↑** to submit your question.

   The agent then translates natural language questions into structured queries, executes queries against governed dbt models and metrics, and returns results with references, assumptions, and possible next steps.

   The agent can loop through these steps multiple times if it hasn't reached a complete answer, allowing for complex, multi-step analysis.⁠

5. Confirm the results or continue asking the agent for more insights about your data. 

Your conversation with the agent remains even if you switch tabs within dbt <Constant name="query_page" />. However, they disappear when you navigate out of <Constant name="query_page" /> or when you close your browser.
