<Constant name="cloud" /> is the fastest and most reliable way to deploy your dbt jobs. It contains a myriad of settings that can be configured by admins, from the necessities (data platform integration) to security enhancements (SSO) and quality-of-life features (RBAC).

This portion of our documentation will take you through the various settings in the <Constant name="cloud" /> UI, including:

- [Connecting to a data platform](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections)
- Configuring access to [GitHub](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github), [GitLab](/docs/cloud/git/connect-gitlab), or your own [git repo URL](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url).
- [Managing users and licenses](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users)
- [Configuring secure access](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access)

For steps on installing <Constant name="cloud" /> development tools, refer to the [<Constant name="cloud" /> CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) or the [<Constant name="cloud_ide" /> (browser-based)](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud).

These settings are intended for <Constant name="cloud" /> administrators. If you need a more detailed first-time setup guide for specific data platforms, read our [quickstart guides](/guides). If you want a more in-depth learning experience, we recommend taking the dbt Fundamentals on our [dbt Learn site](https://learn.getdbt.com/).
