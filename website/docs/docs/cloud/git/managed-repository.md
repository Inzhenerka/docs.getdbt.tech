Managed repositories are a great way to trial dbt without needing to create a new repository. If you don't already have a <Constant name="git" /> repository for your dbt project, you can let <Constant name="cloud" /> host and manage a repository for you. 

If in the future you choose to host this repository elsewhere, you can export the information from <Constant name="cloud" /> at any time. Refer to [Move from a managed repository to a self-hosted repository](/faqs/Git/managed-repo) for more information on how to do that.


:::info
dbt Labs recommends against using a managed repository in a production environment. You can't use <Constant name="git" /> features like pull requests, which are part of our recommended version control best practices.

To set up a project with a managed repository:

1. From your **Account settings** in <Constant name="cloud" />, select the project you want to set up with a managed repository. If the project already has a repository set up, you need to edit the repository settings and disconnect the existing repository.
2. Click **Edit** for the project.
3. Under Repository, click **Configure repository**.
4. Select **Managed**.
5. Enter a name for the repository. For example, "analytics" or "dbt-models."
6. Click **Create**.

## Download managed repository

To download a copy of your managed repository from <Constant name="cloud" /> to your local machine:

1. Use the **Project** selector on the main left-side menu to navigate to a project using a managed repository.
2. Click **Dashboard** from the main left-side menu.
3. From the dashboard, click **Settings**.
4. Locate the **Repository** field and click the hyperlink for the repo.
5. Below the **Deploy key** you can find the **Download repository** option. Click the button to download. If you don't see this option, you're either not assigned a [permission set](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#account-permissions) with `write` access to Git repositories, or you don't have a managed repo for your project.
