#### Claude Code

Run the following command to add the MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add dbt -- uvx --env-file <path-to-.env-file> dbt-mcp
```

By default the MCP server is installed in the "local" scope, meaning that it will be active for Claude Code sessions in the current directory for the user who installed it.

It is also possible to install the MCP server:
- in the "user" scope, to have it installed for all Claude Code sessions, independently of the directory used
- in the "project" scope, to create a config file that can be version controlled so that all developers of the same project can have the MCP server already installed

To install it in the project scope, run the following and and commit the `.mcp.json` file. Be sure to use an env var file path that is the same for all users.
```bash
claude mcp add dbt -s project -- uvx --env-file <path-to-.env-file> dbt-mcp
```
