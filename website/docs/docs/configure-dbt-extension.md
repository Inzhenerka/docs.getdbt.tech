Whether you currently use <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> or self-host with <Constant name="fusion" />, or you’re a <Constant name="core" /> user upgrading to <Constant name="fusion" />, follow the instructions on this page to:

<!-- no toc -->
- [Prepare your local setup](#prepare-your-local-setup)
- [Set environment variables locally](#set-environment-variables-locally)
- [Configure the dbt extension](#configure-the-dbt-extension)

If you're new to dbt or getting started with a new project, you can skip this page and check out our [Quickstart for the <Constant name="fusion_engine"/>](/guides/fusion?step=1) to get started with the dbt extension.

The steps differ slightly depending on whether you use <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> or self host with <Constant name="fusion" />.

- <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> &mdash; You’ll mirror your <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> environment locally to unlock <Constant name="fusion" />-powered features like <Constant name="mesh" />, deferral, and so on. If your project has environment variables, you'll also set them locally to leverage the VS Code extension's features.
- Self-hosted &mdash; When you self-host with <Constant name="fusion" /> or are upgrading from <Constant name="core" /> to <Constant name="fusion" />, you’ll most likely already have a local setup and environment variables. Use this page to confirm that your existing local setup and environment variables work seamlessly with the <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> and VS Code extension.

## Prerequisites

- <Constant name="fusion_engine" /> installed
- Downloaded and installed the dbt VS Code extension
- Basic understanding of [Git workflows](/docs/cloud/git/version-control-basics) and [dbt project structure](/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview)
- [Developer or analyst license](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) if you're using <Constant name="dbt_platform" />

## Prepare your local setup 

In this section, we'll walk you through the steps to prepare your local setup for the dbt VS Code extension. If you're a <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> user that installed the VS Code extension, follow these steps. If you're a self-hosted user, you most likely already have a local setup and environment variables but can confirm using these steps.

1. [Clone](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_cloning-a-repository) your dbt project repository from your Git provider to your local machine. If you use <Constant name="dbt_platform" />, clone the same repo connected to your project.
2. Ensure you have a dbt [`profiles.yml` file](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml). This file defines your data warehouse connection. If you don't have one, run `dbt init` in the terminal to configure your adapter. 
3. Validate your `profiles.yml` and project configuration by running `dbt debug`.
4. Add a `dbt_cloud.yml` file from the <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> Account settings:
   - Navigate to **Your profile** -> **VS Code Extension** -> **Download credentials**.
   - Download the `dbt_cloud.yml` file with your [**Personal access Token (PAT)**](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/user-tokens) included and place it in the `~/.dbt/` directory. This then registers and connects the extension to <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> and enables platform features such as <Constant name="mesh" /> and deferral.
   - Check the `project_id` in your `dbt_project.yml` file matching the project you're working on.
5. Confirm connection from your workstation (like running `dbt debug` in the terminal). Your local computer connects directly to your data warehouse and Git.  
   - <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> users: Ensure your laptop/VPN is allowed; <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> IPs no longer apply. Check with your admin if you have any issues.
   - <Constant name="core" /> users: This has likely already been configured.
6. (Optional) If your project uses environment variables, [find them](/docs/build/environment-variables#setting-and-overriding-environment-variables) in the <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> and [set them](#set-environment-variables-locally) in VS Code or Cursor.
   - <Constant name="dbt_platform" /> users: Copy any environment variables from **Deploy → Environments → Environment variables** tab in <Constant name="dbt_platform" />.  Masked secrets are hidden.  Work with your admin to get those values.

## Set environment variables locally

The extension and CLI use environment variables for authentication and configuration. The following table shows the different options and when to use them:

| Location | Affects | Session state | When to use |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| [**Shell profile** ](#configure-at-the-os--shell-level)| Terminal  | ✅ Permanent | Variables remain active globally and available across terminal sessions.|
| [**VS Code/Cursor settings**](#configure-in-the-vs-code-extension-settings) | Extension menus + <Term id="lsp" /> | ✅ Per VS Code/Cursor profile | Editor-only workflows using the extension menu actions. |
| [**Terminal session**](#configure-in-the-terminal-session)  | Current terminal only | ❌ Temporary | One off testing. |

:::tip 
If you want to use both the VS Code extension menus and terminal to run dbt commands, define your variables in the `shell` profile and VS Code/Cursor settings so they remain active in the terminal globally and in VS Code/Cursor.
:::

#### Configure at the OS or shell level
Define variables once at the OS or shell level to ensure they're available to all terminal sessions. Even if you close a terminal window, the variables will remain available to you.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="mac-linux" label="Mac / Linux">

1. Open your shell configuration file in a text editor using the following commands (If the file does not exist, create it using a text editor using `vi ~/.zshrc` or `vi ~/.bashrc`):
    ```bash
    open -e ~/.zshrc ## for zsh (macOS)
    nano ~/.bashrc ## for bash (Linux or older macOS)
   ```
2. A file will open up and you can add your environment variables to the file. For example:
      - For zsh (macOS):
        ```bash
            ## ~/.zshrc 
            export DBT_ENV_VAR1="my_value"
            export DBT_ENV_VAR2="another_value"
        ```
      - For bash (Linux or older macOS):
        ```bash
            ## ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
            export DBT_ENV_VAR1="my_value"
            export DBT_ENV_VAR2="another_value"
        ```
3. Save the file.  
4. Start a new shell session by closing and reopening the terminal or running `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc` in the terminal.
5. Verify the variables by running `echo $DBT_ENV_VAR1` and `echo $DBT_ENV_VAR2` in the terminal.<br />

If you see the value printed back in the terminal, you're all set! These variables will now be available:
- In all future terminal sessions
- For all dbt commands run in the terminal

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
There are two ways to create persistent environment variables on Windows: through PowerShell or the System Properties. 

The following steps will explain how to configure environment variables using PowerShell.

**PowerShell**
1. Run the following commands in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DBT_ENV_VAR1","my_value","User")
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DBT_ENV_VAR2","another_value","User")
    ```
1. This saves the variables permanently for your user account. To make them available system-wide for all users, replace "User" with "Machine" (requires admin rights).
2. Then, restart VS Code or select **Developer: Reload Window** for changes to take effect.
3. Verify the changes by running `echo $DBT_ENV_VAR1` and `echo $DBT_ENV_VAR2` in the terminal.

**System properties (Environment Variables)**
1. Press **Start** → search for **Environment Variables** → open **Edit the system environment variables**. 
2. From the **Advanced** tab of the System Properties, click **Environment Variables…**.
3. Under **User variables**, click **New…**.
4. Add the variables and values. For example:
    - Variable name: `DBT_ENV_VAR1`
    - Variable value: `my_value`
5. Repeat for any others, then click **OK**.
6. Restart VS Code or Cursor.
7. Verify the changes by running `echo $DBT_ENV_VAR1` and `echo $DBT_ENV_VAR2` in the terminal.

#### Configure in the VS Code extension settings

To use the dbt extension menu actions/buttons, you can configure environment variables directly in the [VS Code User Settings](vscode://settings/dbt.environmentVariables) interface or in any `.env` file at the root level.
- Configuring in the User Settings works with the dbt extension buttons and menus (for <Term id="lsp" />, "Show build menu," and so on).
- Not inherited by the VS Code terminal or external shells.
- Running a dbt command in the terminal won't fetch or use these variables.

To configure environment variables in VS Code/Cursor:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="user-settings" label="Open User Settings">
1. Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_user-settings) (Cmd + Shift + P for Mac, Ctrl + Shift + P for Windows/Linux).
2. Then select either **Preferences: Open User Settings** in the dropdown menu. 
3. Open the [VS Code user settings page](vscode://settings/dbt.environmentVariables).
4. Search for `dbt.environmentVariables`.
5. In the **dbt:Environment Variables** section, add your item and value for the environment variables.
6. Click **Ok** to save the changes.
7. Reload the VS Code extension to apply the changes. Open the Command Palette and select **Developer: Reload Window**. 
8. Verify the changes by running a dbt command and checking the output.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="env-file" label="Open .env file">
1. In your dbt project, create a `.env` file at the root level (same level as your `dbt_project.yml` file).
2. Add your environment variables to the file. For example:
    ```env
    DBT_ENV_VAR1=my_value
    DBT_ENV_VAR2=another_value
    ```
3. Save the file.
4. Reload the VS Code extension to apply the changes.
5. Verify the changes by running a dbt command using the extension menu button on the top right corner and checking the output.
</TabItem>

<!-- commenting out as this might not be the best way to configure environment variables and we're recommending the .env file instead https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/12106
<TabItem value="settings-json" label="Open Settings (JSON)">
1. Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_user-settings) (Cmd + Shift + P for Mac, Ctrl + Shift + P for Windows/Linux).
2. Then select **Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)** in the dropdown menu. 
3. Open the [JSON](vscode://command/workbench.action.openSettingsJson) file.
4. Add your environment variables as a JSON object to the `.vscode/settings.json` file in your dbt project. For example:
    ```json
    {
    "dbt.environmentVariables": {
      "DBT_ENV_VAR1": "test_santi_value" // replace DBT_ENV_VAR1 and test_santi_value with your own variable and value
     }
    }
    ```
5. Save the changes.
6. Reload the VS Code extension to apply the changes.
7. Verify the changes by running a dbt command and checking the output.

#### Configure in the terminal session

Configure environment variables in the terminal session using the `export` command. Something to keep in mind:
- Doing so will make variables visible to commands that run in that terminal session only. 
- It lasts only for the current session and opening a new terminal will lose the values. 
- The built-in dbt VS Code extension buttons and menus will not pick these up.

To configure environment variables in the terminal session:
1. Run the following command in the terminal, replacing `DBT_ENV_VAR1` and `test1` with your own variable and value.
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="mac-linux" label="Mac / Linux">

        ```bash
        export DBT_ENV_VAR1=test1
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows-cmd" label="Windows Cmd">
    Refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1) for more information on the `set` command.

        ```bash
        set DBT_ENV_VAR1=test1 
        
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows-powershell" label="Windows PowerShell">
    Refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.5#use-the-variable-syntax) for more information on the `$env:` syntax.

        ```bash
        $env:DBT_ENV_VAR1 = "test1"
        ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
2. Verify the changes by running a dbt command and checking the output.
